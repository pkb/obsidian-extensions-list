# Floccus Bookmarks To Markdown Plugin

Obsidian Floccus Bookmarks is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to import and convert bookmarks from an XBEL file into a Markdown file. This plugin is inspired by [Floccus](https://floccus.org/), a browser extension that synchronizes bookmarks across different browsers.

2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian's settings.

## Usage

2. In the left ribbon of Obsidian, click on the bookmark icon to import and convert the bookmarks from the XBEL file.
3. The generated Markdown file will be created in the specified folder path with the specified filename.

## Plugin Settings

The plugin settings can be accessed in the Obsidian settings menu under "Floccus Bookmarks To Markdown Settings". The following settings are available:

- **XBEL Absolute Folder Path**: The absolute folder path of the XBEL file.
- **XBEL Filename**: The filename of the XBEL file.
