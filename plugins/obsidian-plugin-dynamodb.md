# DynamoDB Query Plugin For Obsidian

![header.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leenattress/obsidian-plugin-dynamodb/HEAD/header.png)

> This plugin for Obsidian.md allows you to perform simple AWS DynamoDB queries within your markdown documentation. It was originally designed to aid in single table design by providing a rapid prototyping and querying document during data access pattern discovery.

You create a code block with the type `dynamodb` and inside it write your query. You can use PartiQL or pass the parameters just as you would when using the DynamoDB client in the AWS SDK.

- [PartiQL select statements for DynamoDB - Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.select.html)
- [Query - Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Basic Credentials management (Key/Secret)
- ‚úÖ Query by PartiQL
- ‚úÖ Query by SDK params
- ‚úÖ Render to simple inline table
- ‚úÖ Useful error messages
- ‚úÖ Region selector
- ‚úÖ Quick table info (with GSI and LSI details)
- ‚ùå Deals with complex nested objects
- ‚ùå Deals with large amounts of records (remember to limit)


## Commands

> Press cmd + p to bring up the command search and type...

- `dynamodb-set-region` to change the region your tables are in
- `dynamodb-info-command` to list tables in that region and get some basic info on them, such as their global indexes, or the amount of records

Note that the `dynamodb-info-command` can also be accessed by clickint the dynamo icon on your ribbon, usually located on the top left of Obsidian.

## Examples

### Query with parameters like in the SDK
```
```dynamodb
params:
	TableName: Dynamotable
	KeyConditionExpression: pk = :v1 AND sk = :v2
	ExpressionAttributeValues:
	  ":v1":
	    S: "ORG#3t"
	  ":v2":
	    S: "ORG#3t"
```

### PartiQL query using begins_with on the sk
```
```dynamodb
query: SELECT * FROM Dynamotable WHERE pk = 'ORG#Microsoft' AND begins_with("sk", 'ROLE#') 
```
### PartiQL query pk and sk
```
```dynamodb
query: SELECT * FROM Dynamotable WHERE pk = 'ORG#Microsoft' AND sk = 'ORG#Microsoft'
```
### Has a title and supports emoji
```
```dynamodb
title: üçè PartiQL Scan in a specific region
query: SELECT * FROM Dynamotable
region: us-east-1
```
