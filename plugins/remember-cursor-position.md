# Remember cursor position

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) remembers the cursor position and scroll for each note. This is very convenient when you switch between notes, go from link to link, go back, you do not need to scroll to the place where you were the last time.

The cursor position, scrolling and text selection  for all notes are stored in a file (the path can be set in the settings), so everything is restored even if you close Obsidian and open it again.

It works in edit and preview mode.
