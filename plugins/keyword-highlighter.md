### Use the keyword highlighting

To use the highlighting write down the Keyword followed by a colon `:`. There are three predefined keywords: _TODO_, _ADD_, _FIXME_. For example to highlight a new Todo you can simply write `TODO: prepare a â˜•`.

### Add a new keyword

To add a new keyword just press the button `Add new keyword` (1). Then enter the keyword, followed by the font color and the background color. That's it!

### Edit a keyword

Well, that's easy! Just edit the keyword or the font and background colors.

### Remove a keyword

Easy aswell, just hit the delete button (2).

## Installation

This plugin can be accessed and installed directly from the Obsidian Community Plugin Store. Alternatively, for manual installation, simply download the required files and place them in your Obsidian vault's plugins folder.
