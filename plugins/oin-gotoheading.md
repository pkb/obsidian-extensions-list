This Obsidian plugin provides commands that improve navigation between the headings of a document.

## Commands

 - **Next/Previous heading**: Go to the next/previous heading, based on the current cursor position.
 - **Open switcher**: Open a quick switcher that presents the document's outline and allows you to quickly select a heading to jump to.
 - **In folder: Open switcher**: Open a quick switcher that presents the outlines of all the documents in the current folder, and allows you to quickly select a heading to jump to.

## How to install

Use one of the following methods:

 - Install it from Obsidian Community plugins.
