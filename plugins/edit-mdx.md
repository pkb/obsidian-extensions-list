# Edit-MDX

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which allows users to create and edit mdx files as if they were markdown (.md) files. Does not preview MDX.

Features:
- Registers .mdx file extension as markdown
- Ribbon button to create new .mdx file
- Context-menu item to create new .mdx file

Forked from https://github.com/Basil-Mori/obsidian-edit-gemini

### Compatibility
The required APIs were added in Obsidian **0.11.0**, so that's the minimum required version.

## How to Use
- Press "New New .mdx file" in the side ribbon or file context menu to create an untitled .mdx file
- Select any .mdx file in the file viewer to start editing

## Installation
### Manual
- Download the latest release and extract the zip into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins`
- Disable Restricted Mode if needed and enable the plugin from the Installed Plugins list.
