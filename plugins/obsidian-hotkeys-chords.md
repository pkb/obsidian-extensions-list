# Hotkeys Chords for Obsidian
This plugin allows you to set hotkey chords (sequence of hotkeys) to activate Obsidian commands.
This makes it possible to tie Emacs-like keybinding sequences such as `C-x C-s` to any available Obsidian command (also those exported by other plugins) in the configuration pane of the plugin.

Please open an issue if something is unclear or does not work but I already know I won't have much time to dedicate to it.
