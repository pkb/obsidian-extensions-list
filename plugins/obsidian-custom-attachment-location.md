# Obsidian Custom Attachment location

Customize attachment location with tokens (${fileName}, ${date:format}, etc) like typora.

## Features

- Modify location for attachment folder.
- Modify filename for **Pasted Files**.

## Settings

### Location for New Attachments

- Same to "Files & Links -> Default location for new attachments".
- **Put "./" at the beginning of the path if you want to use relative path.**
- See available [tokens](#tokens).
- example: `assets/${filename}`, `./assets/${filename}`, `./assets/${filename}/${date:YYYY}`

### Pasted File Name

- See available [tokens](#tokens).
- example: `${originalCopiedFilename}-${date:YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS}`, `${filename}-img-${date:YYYYMMDD}`
- Obsidian default: `Pasted image ${date:YYYYMMDDHHmmss}`.
- **Note**: This setting only changes image filename from clipboard. If your attachment is copied from the explorer, obsidian will just copy the original file to the attachment folder without renaming.

### Automatically rename attachment folder

Automatically update attachment folder name if "Location for New Attachments" contains `${filename}`.

### Automatically rename attachment files

- Automatically update attachment files in target md file if "Pasted Image Name" contains `${filename}`.
- Just simply substitute `${filename}` string in attachment filename. So it may be dangerous if multiple files share the same prefix.

### Replace whitespace with hyphen

Automatically replace whitespace in attachment folder and file name with hyphens.

### All lowercase names

Automatically set all characters in folder name and pasted image name to be lowercase.

### Convert pasted images to JPEG

Paste images from clipboard converting them to JPEG.

### JPEG Quality

The smaller the quality, the greater the compression ratio.

### Convert images on drag&drop

If enabled and `Convert pasted images to JPEG` setting is enabled, images drag&dropped into the editor will be converted to JPEG.

### Rename only images

If enabled, only image files will be renamed.

If disabled, all attachment files will be renamed.

### Rename pasted files with known names

If enabled, pasted copied files with known names will be renamed.

If disabled, only clipboard image objects (e.g., screenshots) will be renamed.

### Rename attachments on drag&drop

If enabled, attachments dragged and dropped into the editor will be renamed according to the `Pasted File Name` setting.

### Rename attachments on collecting

If enabled, attachments processed via `Collect attachments` commands will be renamed according to the `Pasted File Name` setting.

### Duplicate name separator

When you are pasting/dragging a file with the same name as an existing file, this separator will be added to the file name.

E.g., when you are dragging file `existingFile.pdf`, it will be renamed to `existingFile 1.pdf`, `existingFile 2.pdf`, etc, getting the first name available.

Default value is ` ` (`space`).

### Keep empty attachment folders

If enabled, empty attachment folders will be preserved, useful for source control purposes.

### Delete orphan attachments

If enabled, when the note is deleted, its orphan attachments are deleted as well.

## Tokens

The following tokens can be used in the [Location for New Attachments](#location-for-new-attachments) and [Pasted File Name](#pasted-file-name) settings.

The tokens are case-insensitive. The formats are case-sensitive.

- `${date:format}`: Current date/time using [Moment.js formatting][Moment.js formatting].
- `${fileCreationDate:format}`: File creation date/time using [Moment.js formatting][Moment.js formatting].
- `${fileModificationDate:format}`: File modification date/time using [Moment.js formatting][Moment.js formatting].
- `${fileName}`: Current note filename.
- `${filePath}`: Full path to current note.
- `${folderName}`: Current note's folder name.
- `${folderPath}`: Full path to current note's folder.
- `${frontmatter:key}`: Frontmatter value of the current note. Nested keys are supported, e.g., `key1.key2.3.key4`.
- `${originalCopiedFileExtension}`: Extension of the original copied to clipboard or dragged file.
- `${originalCopiedFileName}`: File name of the original copied to clipboard or dragged file.
- `${prompt}`: The value asked from the user prompt.
- `${randomDigit}`: A random digit.
- `${randomDigitOrLetter}`: A random digit or letter.
- `${randomLetter}`: A random letter.
- `${uuid}`: A random UUID.

## Custom tokens

You can define custom tokens in the `Custom tokens` setting.

The custom tokens are defined as a functions, both sync and async are supported.

Example:

```javascript
exports.myCustomToken1 = (substitutions, app, format) => {
  return substitutions.fileName + app.appId + format;
}

exports.myCustomToken2 = async (substitutions, app, format) => {
  return await Promise.resolve(substitutions.fileName + app.appId + format);
}
```

Then you can use the defined `${myCustomToken1}`, `${myCustomToken2:format}` tokens in the [Location for New Attachments](#location-for-new-attachments) and [Pasted File Name](#pasted-file-name) settings.

- `substitutions`: is an object with the following properties:
  - `fileName`: The filename of the current note.
  - `filePath`: The full path to the current note.
  - `folderName`: The name of the folder containing the current note.
  - `folderPath`: The full path to the folder containing the current note.
  - `originalCopiedFileExtension`: Extension of the original copied to clipboard or dragged file.
  - `originalCopiedFileName`: File name of the original copied to clipboard or dragged file.
- `app`: Obsidian app object.
- `format`: optional format string.
