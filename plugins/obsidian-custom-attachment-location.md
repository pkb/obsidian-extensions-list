# Obsidian Custom Attachment location

Customize attachment location with variables($filename, $data, etc) like typora.

## Features

- Modify location for attachment folder.
- Modify filename for **Pasted Files**.

## Settings

### Location for New Attachments

- Same to "Files & Links -> Default location for new attachments".
- `${filename}` representing for current note filename.
- `${foldername}` representing for current note's folder name.
- `${folderPath}` representing for full path to current note's folder.
- `${date:format}` representing for the current date/time using [Moment.js formatting][Moment.js formatting].
- **Put "./" at the beginning of the path if you want to use relative path.**
- example: `assets/${filename}`, `./assets/${filename}`, `./assets/${filename}/${date:YYYY}`

### Pasted File Name

- `${filename}` representing for current note filename.
- `${foldername}` representing for current note's folder name.
- `${date:format}` representing for the current date/time using [Moment.js formatting][Moment.js formatting].
- `${originalCopiedFilename}` representing for original copied to clipboard filename.
- `${prompt}` representing the value asked from the user prompt.
- example: `${originalCopiedFilename}-${date:YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS}`, `${filename}-img-${date:YYYYMMDD}`
- Obsidian default: `Pasted image YYYYMMDDHHmmss`.
- **Note**: This setting only changes image filename from clipboard. If your attachment is copied from the explorer, obsidian will just copy the original file to the attachment folder without renaming.

### Automatically rename attachment folder

Automatically update attachment folder name if "Location for New Attachments" contains `${filename}`.

### Automatically rename attachment files

- Automatically update attachment files in target md file if "Pasted Image Name" contains `${filename}`.
- Just simply substitute `${filename}` string in attachment filename. So it may be dangerous if multiple files share the same prefix.

### Replace whitespace with hyphen

Automatically replace whitespace in attachment folder and file name with hyphens.

### All lowercase names

Automatically set all characters in folder name and pasted image name to be lowercase.

### Convert pasted images to JPEG

Paste images from clipboard converting them to JPEG.

### JPEG Quality

The smaller the quality, the greater the compression ratio.

### Convert images on drag&drop

If enabled and `Convert pasted images to JPEG` setting is enabled, images drag&dropped into the editor will be converted to JPEG.

### Rename only images

If enabled, only image files will be renamed.

If disabled, all attachment files will be renamed.

### Rename pasted files with known names

If enabled, pasted copied files with known names will be renamed.

If disabled, only clipboard image objects (e.g., screenshots) will be renamed.

### Rename attachments on drag&drop

If enabled, attachments dragged and dropped into the editor will be renamed according to the `Pasted File Name` setting.

### Rename attachments on collecting

If enabled, attachments processed via `Collect attachments` commands will be renamed according to the `Pasted File Name` setting.

### Duplicate name separator

When you are pasting/dragging a file with the same name as an existing file, this separator will be added to the file name.

E.g., when you are dragging file `existingFile.pdf`, it will be renamed to `existingFile 1.pdf`, `existingFile 2.pdf`, etc, getting the first name available.

Default value is ` ` (`space`).

### Keep empty attachment folders

If enabled, empty attachment folders will be preserved, useful for source control purposes.

### Delete orphan attachments

If enabled, when the note is deleted, its orphan attachments are deleted as well.
