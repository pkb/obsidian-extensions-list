# Mark and Select

This is a Obsidian plug in, provides flexible commands to select a region of text.

Usage
- Set mark (Ctrl-@)
- Select from mark (Ctrl-#)

By combining with other cursor navigation methods, this plugin can be very powerful. For example, to select the content of one heading, below are the steps:
- Set mark
- Jump to next heading by "Quick Switcher++: Open in Symbol Mode"
- Select from mark

This plugin is especially useful for Obsidian mobile, since selection by long tap + scrolling is very slow for long texts and the selection could easily disappear (may be a bug in mobile phone).
