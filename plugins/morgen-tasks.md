# Instructions: Connecting Morgen to Obsidian

Plan, time block, and track tasks from your Obsidian vault in any calendar using Morgen.

-----

Plan and schedule your Obsidian tasks in your calendar to protect focused time and prevent double-bookings. See your tasks side-by-side with your calendar, then drag and drop them in your calendar. 
You can even create multiple time slots for large tasks, filter based on due dates and priority, and sync task status back to Obsidian.

To see the plugin in action check out [Journaling in Obsidian onto my Morgen Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxdQE8i95po) by Danny Hatcher.

## FAQ

### Do my tasks get synced to my Morgen mobile app?

Not right now but please feel free to send us some feedback

### Can I sync Obsidian notes themselves as tasks in Morgen?

At the moment only checklist tasks within notes are synced, but we are considering the possibility of using the frontmatter of notes to sync them as a parent task or a task sub-list.

## Future

 - Support for notes as tasks
 - Support for the [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://morgen.canny.io/feature-requests/p/obsidian-integration-kanban-plugin-support)
 - Extended functionality provided by this plugin
