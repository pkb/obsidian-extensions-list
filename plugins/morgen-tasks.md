# Instructions: Connecting Morgen to Obsidian

Plan, time block, and track tasks from your Obsidian vault in any calendar using Morgen.

-----

Plan and schedule your Obsidian tasks in your calendar to protect focused time
and prevent double-bookings. See your tasks side-by-side with your calendar,
then drag and drop them in your calendar. You can even create multiple time
slots for large tasks, filter based on due dates and priority, and sync task
status back to Obsidian.

## Features

- Connect your vault to see your Obsidian tasks next to your calendar
- Display the information you need, including deadlines, priorities, and more
- Drag tasks onto your calendar for seamless time blocking
- Add done date in Obsidian to tasks marked as complete in Morgen
- Auto-schedule next instance of recurring tasks
- Connect multiple calendars, including CalDAVs
- Available on MacOS, Windows and Linux

## Plugin Features
 - Declutter your Obsidian task lists by hiding task IDs or replacing them with a simple emoji

## Requirements

 - [Obsidian Tasks Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction)
 - [Emoji Tasks Format](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format)

## FAQ

### Do my tasks get synced to my Morgen mobile app?

Not right now but please feel free to send us some feedback

### Can I sync Obsidian notes themselves as tasks in Morgen?

At the moment only checklist tasks within notes are synced, but we are
considering the possibility of using the frontmatter of notes to sync them
as a parent task or a task sub-list.

## Future

 - Support for notes as tasks
 - Support for the [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://morgen.canny.io/feature-requests/p/obsidian-integration-kanban-plugin-support)
 - Extended functionality provided by this plugin
