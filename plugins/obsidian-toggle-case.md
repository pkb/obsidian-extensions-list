# NO LONGER SUPPORTED

> [!WARNING]
> i've stopped maintaining this repo as personally i've moved to using [obsidian-editor-shortcuts](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts) it does everything this plugin does and way more.

# Toggle Case

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds a command to toggle the case of your selection between `lowercase` => `Title Case` => `UPPERCASE` 

| Command                                        | Shortcut \* |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Toggle Case                                    | Not set     |

### Multiple Cursors

The shortcut also works with [multiple cursors](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+cursors):

## Installing the plugin

Refer to the official installation instructions for third-party plugins [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins).

## Configuring settings

Go to Settings â†’ Hotkeys to customise the keyboard shortcut for "Toggle Case".

## Thanks

Many thanks to [obsidian-editor-shortcuts](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts) from which this is largely copied / based on.
Take a look if you want a much more comprehensive set of common code editor shortcuts.
