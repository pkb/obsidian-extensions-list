# PARA Workflower

`PARA Workflower` is an Obsidian plugin to make managing your Vault using the PARA Method, by Tiago Forte, a lot easier.  
This plugin offers you a handful of very useful commands to  
- Initialize your Vault and prepare it to use PARA method with this plugin
- Create a new Project, Area or Resource
- Easily archive your PARA items (Project, Area, Resource) using the plugin commands
- Restore projects, areas and resources directly or via the plugin's handy fuzzy search function

## Changelog v0.1.5

> [!warning] 
> THIS VERSION MAY CONTAINS BREAKING CHANGES

- added input validation in modal when creating a project, area or resource   

- added command `Move to archive`  
This command will move the currently open project / area / resource to the archive.  
If the file is an `area`, the companion folder (if exists) is also moved. The area note and companion folder are then placed within a subfolder named after the area in your archive folder.  
If the file is a `project` and within a project folder the whole project folder will be moved to the archive  
	
- added command `Restore from archive`  
Restores the currently open PARA item or opens a modal in which you can search for an archived project, area or resource that you want to restore.  
This change is for a more convenient use of the plugin and is now the only command for restoring archived elements.  
If you call the command without a file being open or not archived, the search modal is opened.  
If you call the command with a currently open and archived PARA item, this will be restored immediately.  

- command `Create new project` now checks whether a project with the same name (case insensitive) already exists in the projects or archive folder

- removed command `Archive current project`
- removed command `Restore open project from archive`
- removed command `Restore project from archive`   

- add support for project folder structure  
You can enable folder structure for projects under the plugin settings `Use folder structure for projects`.  
All corresponding commands can now handle both flat and folder structures for projects.  

> All projects created w/o a project folder (flat) will still be handled as flat projects (single file). This might be changed in the future.
