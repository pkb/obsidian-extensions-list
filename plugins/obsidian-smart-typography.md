## Obsidian Smart Typography

This plugin (currently) converts:

- `""` to `“”` - curly double quotes (customizable)
- `''` to `‘’` - curly single quotes (customizable)
- `...` to `…` - ellipsis
- `->` to `→` (customizable)
- `<-` to `←` (customizable)
- `<<` to `«`
- `>>` to `»`
- Two dashes (`--`) to – - en-dash
- En-dash + dash (`–-`) to — - em-dash
- Em-dash + dash (`—-`) to `---` - three dashes
- Fractions:
  - `1/2` to `½`
  - `⅓`, `⅔`
  - `¼`, `¾`
  - `⅕`, `⅖`, `⅗`, `⅘`
  - `⅙`, `⅚`
  - `⅐`
  - `⅛`, `⅜`, `⅝`, `⅞`
  - `⅑`
  - `⅒`
- Comparisons:
  - `<=` to `≤`
  - `>=` to `≥`
  - `/=` to `≠`

as you type. Any automatic changes can be undone by pressing backspace.

I hope to expand this to support the conventions of other languages. **You can help me out with this by submitting an issue here, telling me what these conventions are**: https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography/issues
