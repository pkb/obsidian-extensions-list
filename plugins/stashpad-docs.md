# Stashpad Docs Plugin

This is a plugin for interacting with Stashpad Docs (https://stashpad.com) from Obsidian.

This can be useful if you've written a note in Obsidian, and now would like to share it with others via Stashpad Docs.

To use it, when you're on the note you'd like to share, trigger the "Share to Stashpad Docs" command via either the Ribbon action or the command palette.

This will create a new Stashpad Doc with the contents of your note, and open it in your browser.
