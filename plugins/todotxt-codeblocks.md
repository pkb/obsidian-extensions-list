# obsidian-todotxt-codeblocks

## Description
A codeblock alternative to mvgrimes's [obsidian-todotxt-plugin](https://github.com/mvgrimes/obsidian-todotxt-plugin) based on the [Todo.txt specs](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

Add your tasks to a `todotxt` codeblock to get started!

Link your codeblock to an existing *.txt file to synchronize changes.

  - [x] `src:` Link a *.txt file to the todotxt codeblock
  - [ ] `filter:`

## Extensions
  - date formats
    - \<YYYY-MM-DD> (ex. 1996-08-06)
    - \<MM-DD> (ex. 08-06)
    - \<n><[dateUnit]> (ex. 1w = 1 week from today)
      - calculates date n number of dateUnits away
      - dateUnits: d, w, m, y, b (business day)
      - if only a number is provided, it will calculate **d**ays (ex. 0 = today, 1 = tomorrow, 7 = next week)
    - \<dayOfWeek> (ex. M = next Monday)
      - calculates date for first upcoming dayOfWeek
      - M, Tu, W, Th, F, Sa, Su
    - dayOfWeek and dateUnits (except b) can be combined (dayOfWeek must come first)
      - 1w2d = 9 days (1 **w**eek + 2 **d**ays)
      - Su5d = first upcoming **Su**nday in 5 **d**ays
    - if the `rec:` value is prefixed with a plus (ex. rec:+1w), the date is determined from the original due date rather than the completed date
