%% README_START %%

**Indenting content under headers based on their level** is a visual technique to create a visual hierarchy that makes it easier to understand the structure and organization of your document and facilitates the application of **selective attention** on specific structure part. 

- You can specify the margins for the content of each heading in plugin settings
- Also you can add your own custom css to the headings and their content, using the classes `data_h1/2/3/4/5/6` and `heading_h1/2/3/4/5/6` appended to each rendered section in reading view

## Install

You can download from *Community plugins* in Obsidian settings

## ideas

You can combine different heading indent with custom CSS. For example, I prefer use h1 heading as title of a note in custom centered format, and the rest of headings as hierarchy, each one with different format in order to make more visual difference:

This plugin is handly combined with `fold heading` option and [creases](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-creases) plugin to assign folding of specific heading level to a shortcut
