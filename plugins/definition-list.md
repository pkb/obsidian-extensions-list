# Definition List Plugin

This plugin adds HTML definition lists to Obsidian. It is in the very early stages of development, and quite a bit more is planned.

It supports both reading view and live preview/source mode.

## Credit

Special thanks to [@lucible](https://github.com/lucible) who, at this point, has contributed more to this project than I have. Thank you! Additionally, thanks go to the following contributors:

## Usage

While definition lists are not part of the standard markdown definition, a number of varients have introduced it. This plugin has adopted the markup standard as described in the [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/). It also implements a few features from [Pandoc's definition list spec](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists), specifically the support for tilde as a definition marker and definition lines indented with two spaces.

```
First Term
: First definition.

Second Term
~ Second definition
~ Alternate second definition with _italics_ and [a link](https://example.com).

Third Term, with _Italics_ and ==Highlighting==
  : Third definition, indented
```

Multiple definitions with line breaks between them are not fully supported. For example, the following is supported in Pandoc but will **not** render as 1 term with 2 definitions in reading mode. It does render in live preview, though.

```
This is an example term
: this is the first definition

: this is another definition.
```

### Strict Line Breaks

If you use strict line breaks, you need to use a '\' at the end of lines as follows.

```
Definition term \
: Definition definition
```

### Unsupported Definition List Mark-up

- Multi-line terms
- Multi-line/paragraph definitions
- Definition lists nested inside definitions
- Ordered & unordered lists nested inside definitions

## Styling

Because definition lists are not part of the standard Obsidian markup, they are not recognized by any of the available themes. This plugin adds a couple bits of simple styling, but you will likely have to use [CSS Snippits](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets) to style to match your themes.

If you come up with some CSS that matches a popular theme please share it by creating a [Github Issue](https://github.com/shammond42/definition-list/issues) on this project. I would like to build a collection of CSS samples others can use.

## Future Work

1. Build a collection of sample CSS snippits
1. Settings to account for common alternatives
    - dt's and dd's inline vs separate lines
1. Use eslint and improve code quality

## Building from Source

Clone this repository inside the Obsidian Vault:

```
$ cd .obsidian/plugins/
$ git clone https://github.com/shammond42/definition-list
```

Resolve the plugin dependencies and build it:

```
$ cd definition-list
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin from *Community Plugins* in Settings.

If you wish to make changes to the plugin, run `npm run dev`
instead of `npm run build`.
