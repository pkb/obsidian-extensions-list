## Obsidian Julian Date Plugin

This is a simple plugin that add an hotkey for inserting a Julian Date. The Julian Date is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and is used primarily by astronomers for annotating astronomical events.

The default hotkey is `Ctrl+Shift+J`.

## How to compile the plugin

First, install the dependencies with

```bash
npm i
```

Then, you can compile the plugin with:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `main.js` file in the project root. That is the entry point of the Julian Date plugin.
