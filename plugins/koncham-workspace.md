# koncham workspace

an obsidian plugin to enhance the workspace

## features

### 'Center-panes' view on sidebar (vertical tabs)

This is a tab on the left side-bar that lists all the panes open in the main area. This works a little like vertical tabs (in vivaldi and edge browsers).

features of this view:
+ switch to any pane with one click
+ active note is highlighted
+ more features exposed through right-clicking the tab header

This view is useful when using obsidian in ways that hide some open panes.

examples of such modes include:
+ sliding-panes
+ maximize active pane

This screen recording demonstrates usage in the default and maximized modes:

### pin/unpin panes

Pinning all panes forces every new note to open in it's own pane.
When some external applications open a note in Obsidian, they switch away from the last active un-pinned pane. Pinning prevents losing your existing open notes.

## features planned

+ more functionality in `center panes` view through right click
+ pane switcher modal
+ pane arrangements such as (1+1), (1+2) using commands
+ rearrange panes in alphabetical order

## known issues
