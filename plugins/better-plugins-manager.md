In the ecosystem of Obsidian, plugins play a key role in expanding functionality and enhancing workflow efficiency. Although Obsidian provides basic plugin management capabilities, for users who pursue higher management efficiency and personalized experiences, these may not be sufficient. Better Plugins Manager (BPM) is born out of this need, aiming to surpass basic functionalities and offer a more refined and powerful plugin management solution.

## Features

- **Plugin Delayed Startup**: BPM allows you to set personalized delay times for each plugin, reducing startup time and enhancing application performance.

- **Customizable Interface**: BPM offers personalized settings, allowing you to customize the interface according to your preferences and workflow.
- **Convenient Directory Access**: BPM lets you access the plugin directory with one click, making it easy to manage and edit at a deeper level, meeting your advanced management needs.
- **Quick Plugin Toggle**: BPM simplifies the process of enabling and disabling plugins with one-click operations, allowing you to respond to changes quickly without going through complicated setup steps.
- **Plugin Renaming**: BPM allows you to rename plugins based on their actual function or personal preference, making your plugin list more intuitive and personalized.
- **Description Editing**: BPM allows you to edit plugin descriptions based on their actual use or personal experience, making your plugin list more aligned with your personal workflow.
- **Group Management**: BPM introduces group management functionality, allowing you to logically group plugins for easier management 和 quick access, enhancing work efficiency.
- **Tagging Management**: BPM enables you to add personalized tags to plugins, whether by function, frequency of use, or personal categorization, making your plugin management more organized.
- **Advanced Search**: BPM offers an advanced search feature, allowing you to quickly locate the plugins you need, whether by name, group, or tag, making it easy to find them.
