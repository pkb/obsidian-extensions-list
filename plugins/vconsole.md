# Obsidian vConsole

## About

For developers, debugging mobile plugins is usually quite troublesome, requiring specific work for both Android and iOS.

For average users who want to submit issues to developers for troubleshooting, this adds an extra layer of difficulty.

Fortunately, [vConsole](https://github.com/Tencent/vConsole) offers the ability to open debugging tools directly on the page. This plugin brings that capability into Obsidian.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note, if you're not a developer or if you don't need to troubleshoot plugin bugs, then you should **not** install this plugin.

## Installation

Search `vconsole` in community plugins.
