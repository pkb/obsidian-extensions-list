# Editor Autofocus, plugin for Obsidian

This plugin autofocuses the editor window.

It works best with [Filename heading sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync) to make creating new notes easy and efficient: this plugin lets you skip entering a name in the the tab title bar by autofocusing the editor window. After autofocusing, it selects the heading (if there is a heading on the first line) in order to let you directly rename the title / note.

Autofocus will only happen if a note has less than 3 lines.
The first heading will only be selected if there is one on the first line of the note (the plugin "Filename heading sync" creates such a heading automatically).

Please let me know if you use this plugin!
