# Obsidian Open with Natural Language Dates

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that adds a command that lets you quickly open a daily note using natural language. It requires the [Natural Language Dates](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian/tree/master) plugin to be enabled.

I wrote this plugin because I needed a faster way to open a daily note without needing to use a calendar or remember the exact file name. This is useful if you're trying to recall something or want to add to a future daily note. Thanks [@argenos](https://github.com/argenos) for writing Natural Language Dates, which inspired this plugin.
