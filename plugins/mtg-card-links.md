# MTG Card Links

Link to Magic: the Gathering cards by enclosing the card name in square brackets. 
Card names are fuzzy matched, so any of the following will link to [Esika, God of the Tree // The Prismatic Bridge](https://scryfall.com/card/khm/168/esika-god-of-the-tree-the-prismatic-bridge)

- [Esika, God of the Tree // The Prismatic Bridge]
- [Esika God of the Tree]
- [God Esika]

Sets can be specified with the format [Card Name|Set Name], and collector 
numbers can be specified with the format [Card Name|Set Name|123]
