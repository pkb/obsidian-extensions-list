# Kindle Highlights Importer (HTML to MD)

This simple plugin enables you to import your Kindle highlights HTML file into Obsidian. The Kindle HTML file will be converted into a Markdown file and saved to your specified location.

## How to Use This Plugin
1. Install the plugin.

2. Select the folder where you want your notes with your highlights to be saved from the plugin settings.

3. Launch your Kindle app and open any book from which you want to export highlights.

4. Tap on the center of the screen and click on the small notebook icon in the top bar of your screen.

5. Tap on the small "Share" icon in the top right corner of your screen.

6. Choose "EXPORT NOTEBOOK."

7. Select "APA" for the citation style.

8. Select "Export" and choose a method to send the file to yourself (I personally send it to myself via email).

9. Once you have the HTML file ready, return to Obsidian and open the command palette (Ctrl+P).

10. Search for the "Kindle Highlights Importer" command and select it.

11. Select your HTML file from the file picker and click "Import Highlights from the file."

12. Congratulations, you've successfully imported your highlights! A small notification should appear confirming the successful process.
