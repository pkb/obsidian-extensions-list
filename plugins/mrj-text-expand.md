# Text expand

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrjackphil/obsidian-text-expand/HEAD/screenshots/1.gif)

This plugin will search files using [Obsidian search functionality](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Search)
and then paste the result. The output can be customized using [template feature](#template-engines).

## Table of Contents

- [Basic usage](#how-to-use)
- [Search functionality]()
- [Template engines](#template-engines)
    - [eta](#eta-template-engine)
    - [sequences](#sequence-template-engine-legacy)
        - [Available sequences](#special-sequences)

## How to use
- You should wrap your search request like that
```
    ```expander
    SEARCH_QUERY
    ```
```
- Open command palette (`Ctrl + P`)
- Find and run `Text expand: expand` command
- It should search and put results below the wrapped request

## Search functionality

First line in expander code block is always a search request.
You can leave it empty to use results from search panel as is.

Once searching, plugin waits some time (configurable) and extract results from
search panel to template engine.
 
## Template engines

### eta template engine

You can use [eta](https://eta.js.org) template engine for managing results.

```
## <%= it.current.frontmatter.title %>

<% it.files.forEach(file => { %>
   - <%= file.link %> 
<% }) %>
```

Use `it` object to access search results and fields for current file.

| `it.current` | FileParameters        | Info about current file          |
| `it.files`   | Array<FileParameters> | Info about files in search panel |

`FileParameters` type has those fields.

### sequence template engine (LEGACY)
Using template feature you can customize an output. 
- Put template below the SEARCH_QUERY line
- Put a cursor inside code block with a template
- Open command palette (`Ctrl+P`) and find `Text expand: expand` command

To create a list:

    ```expander
    SEARCH_QUERY
    - [[$filename]]
    ```

or to create a table:

    ```expander
    SEARCH_QUERY
    ^|Filename|Content|
    ^|---|---|
    |$filename|$lines:1|
    ```


Syntax looks like that:

    ```expander
    SEARCH_QUERY
    ^This is a header
    This line will be repeated for each file
    Also, [[$filename]] <- this will be a link
    >This is a footer
    ```

- Line prepended with `^` is a header. It will be added at the top of the list
- Line prepended with `>` is a footer. It will be added at the bottom of the list
- Line with no special symbol at start will be repeated for each file. Also, all special sequences will be replaced.
