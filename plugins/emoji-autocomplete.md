## Credits
Thanks to [@claremacrae](https://github.com/claremacrae) for rigorous testing of this plugin, which led to a significant performance improvements.
libraries / packages that were used but modified or otherwise embedded (not in package.json)
- `is-emoji-supported` modified the canvas with `willReadFrequently: true` and custom cache handling
- `country-flag-emoji-polyfill` took the font and wrote custom applying logic
- `lucide` icon pack and `icones.js.org` for several nice svg icons

## Performance Improvements
Emoji shortcodes has an issue where it slows down the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) and [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugins by a huge amount.  
(You can check the progress on the issue in in [this issue](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-emoji-shortcodes/issues/47))
