# MagicCalendar
AI-Powered Obsidian plugin that leverages natural language processing techniques to find calendar events in Markdown notes, seamlessly synchronizing them with a calendar of choice. <br>
The plugin is still in beta and at the moment the supported calendars are:
- Apple Calendar
- Google Calendar

# Functionalities
## NLP calendar events recognition
Just write your events and seamlessly synchronize them with your calendar

</p>

It might happen that some patterns are incorrectly recognized as calendar events. **Just ban them!**

</p>

On the other hand, it could be possible that some patterns are not recognized. You can use your custom delimitators to define an event:

</p>

## Inline event view
Embed your events in your notes with a simple syntax. <br>
The Inline event view is two-way synchronized *(at the moment supported only by Apple Calendar. Google Calendar push notification need an HTTPS server)*.

# Getting started
### Automatic installation
Browse the community plugins and look for "MagicCalendar".
### Manual installation
- Check the [latest release](https://github.com/Vaccarini-Lorenzo/MagicCalendar/releases/latest)
- Download ```magic-calendar.zip```
- Unzip the file and move the ```magic-calendar``` folder into your Obsidian plugin folder
- Enable the plugin from your Obsidian settings.

### Log-in
To log-in just click on the calendar ribbon icon to select your calendar provider.
Unfortunately, Apple doesn't provide an OAuth2 authentication and to interact with Apple Calendar you'll need to log-in into your iCloud account.
Your credentials will be stored <ins>exclusively</ins> in your local device (encrypted).<br> Check the **How it works** section for more informations.<br>

</p>

Google, on the other hand, supports OAuth2 authentication.
At the moment, the application is being reviewed by Google Trust & Safety team, therefore a security page will be presented.

### Enjoy
That's it. Just write an event and the plugin will try its best to identify it. </br>
To embed your calendar in your notes just use the following syntax **in a code block**: <br>
```<magic> from:YYYY/MM/DD to:YYYY/MM/DD```


# How it works
### NLP module
The plugin works on top of a **NLP** library [(NLP wink)](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/). <br>
First, the sentence is split into tokens, entities and Part-of-Speeches. Once the sentence has been broken down into understandable components, it's time to filter them following common patterns that include dates, times, durations, event-related nouns and purposes. In order to keep iCalSync lightweight, the number of patterns is not huge, nevertheless the recognition process scores high levels of precision.

### iCloud module
The communication with iCloud wouldn't be possible without the help of [iCloud.js](https://github.com/foxt/icloud.js.git). The library has been opportunely modified to support POST requests and bypass CORS policies. <br>
Since Apple doesn't support OAuth, it's necessary to login with email and password. These inserted credentials are stored exclusively in your local device (AES encrypted) in order to avoid a manual login everytime a token refresh is needed. The encryption key is randomly generated when the plugin is installed. It can be manually changed in the settings section (not recommended).
