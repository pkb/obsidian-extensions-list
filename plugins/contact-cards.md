# Obsidian Contact Cards Plugin

The Obsidian Contact Cards Plugin transforms YAML data inside a special code block into a beautifully designed contact card. This lets you quickly view a person's details (even in preview mode).

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aegixx/obsidian-contact-cards/HEAD/example.gif)

**NOTE:** This plugin utilizes third-party services:

- Avatars are pulled from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/), based on email address.
- Company logos retrieved from [Brandfetch](https://brandfetch.com), based on email domain.

## Features

- **Beautiful Formatting**: Display name, title, company, email, and phone number in a clean, business-card style layout.
- **Simple Syntax**: Just provide a `contact-card` code block with YAML fields, and the plugin will handle the rest.
- **Customizable**: Adjust styling by modifying the pluginâ€™s CSS or by creating your own Obsidian CSS snippets.
- **Powerful Integrations**:
  - Photos automatically populated based on email address
  - Company logos pulled based on email domain (when Company name is provided)
  - Clickable fields for more context (phone, email, location, etc)

## Attribution

## Development

- Fork the repo & clone to a local development folder. For convenience, you can place this folder in your `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-contact-cards` folder or symlink it!
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
- Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin.
- Enable plugin in settings window.

## Example

**Add a code block** to your note:

```md
    ```contact-card
    name: Bryan Stone
    email: bryan@steampunk.dev
    company: Steampunk Labs
    title: Founder & Managing Partner
    phone: 2565551234

## Customization

The `obsidian-contact-cards` plugin allows for several customizable settings to tailor the behavior and design of your contact cards. Below are the available options you can configure:

### Settings

1. **Brandfetch Client ID**
   - **Description:** Company logos are retrieved using the email domain via the Brandfetch API. To use this API, you must register for a Client ID. This service is available free of charge.
   - **Note:** Register for your free Brandfetch API key [here](https://brandfetch.io/).

2. **Default Country Code**
   - **Description:** This setting determines the country code used for phone number formatting. Provide the 2-letter country code (e.g., "GB" for the United Kingdom, "IN" for India)
   - **Default:** "US"

### Styling

The `obsidian-contact-cards` plugin provides several customizable CSS classes to help you personalize the appearance of the business cards. You can override these styles in your own stylesheet to create a custom look and feel. Below are the available classes and their purposes:

#### Available CSS Classes

- **`.contact-card-content`** - The outer container for the card, this is used for layout & sizing.
- **`.contact-card`** - The inner container that holds the profile image, logo, and contact information.
- **`.contact-card-photo`** - Profile photo image of the contact.
- **`.contact-card-logo`** - Company logo displayed on the card.
- **`.contact-card-info`** - Container for the contact's name, title, company, and other information.
- **`.contact-card-name`** - The name of the contact.
- **`.contact-card-title`** - The title/position of the contact.
- **`.contact-card-separator`** - A separator between sections in the contact info (e.g., between name and company).
- **`.contact-card-error`** - Applied to elements displaying an error message.

#### Animations

- **`.contact-card-content`** - This class uses the `animatop` animation to slide the background shape into view.
- **`.contact-card:after`** - This class defines the background shape displayed behind the card.

## Roadmap

- Add support for additional "power" fields with custom functionality (e.g. social media links, skills)
- Add richer integration for finding a contact's photo
