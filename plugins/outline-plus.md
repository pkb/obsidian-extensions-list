# Obsidian Outline++

This [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin provides an option to render markdown in it.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin was originally developed to fix [a bug of the built-in outline view](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/headings-with-numbers-miss-in-toc-outline-of-heading/65155?u=ush), which has been already fixed in Obsidian v1.5.4.

## Installation

Since this plugin is still awaiting approval from the Obsidian team, it's not available in the community plugin browser yet.

But you can install the latest beta release using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

1. Install the latest version of BRAT and enable it.
2. _(Optional but highly recommended)_ In the BRAT settings, turn on `Auto-update plugins at startup` at the top of the page.
3. Open the following URL in browser: `obsidian://brat?plugin=RyotaUshio/obsidian-outline-plus`.
4. Click the "Add Plugin" button.
