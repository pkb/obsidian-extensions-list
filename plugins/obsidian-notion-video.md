## Introduction

This plugin can embed your notion video in obsidian through the Notion API, You need to provide Notion intergration secrets in the settings and enter the corresponding block_id to get the content of the block.

## Usage

First you need to go to the plugin's settings page and enter secrets here, if you don't know what secrets are you can see [this page](https://developers.notion.com/docs).

And you will see a modal prompting you to enter block_id. With this block_id you can get the content on the Notion and it will be inserted into the page.
