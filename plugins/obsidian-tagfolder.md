## TagFolder

This is the plugin that shows your tags like folders.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfolder/HEAD/images/screenshot.png)

### How to use

Install this plugin, press `Ctrl+p`, and choose "Show Tag Folder".

### Behavior

This plugin creates a tree by tags permutation.

Like this,
### Simple case

If you have docs,
```
Apple : #food #red #sweet
Pear  : #food #green #sweet
Tuna  : #food #red
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfolder/HEAD/images/simplecase.png)

...and more are shown.

### Case of respecting nested tags

The nested tag works well for Tag Folder.

Tag Folder respects nested tags and makes the dedicated hierarchy. The nested child doesn't leak out over the parent.

```
TagFolder Readme: #dev #readme #2021/12/10 #status/draft
Technical information: #dev #note #2021/12/09 #status/draft
SelfHosted LiveSync Readme : #dev #readme #2021/12/06 #status/proofread
Old Note: #dev #readme #2021/12/10 #status/abandoned
```
#### Tag hierarchy of status

#### Tag hierarchy of date

#### Search tags
You can search tags. like this:

```
sweet -red | food -sweet
```
When using this filter, this plugin shows only "Pear" (Sweet but not red) and "Tuna" (food but not sweet).

### Settings

#### Behavior

##### Always Open

Place TagFolder on the left pane and activate it at every Obsidian launch.

##### Use pinning
We can pin the tag if we enable this option.  
When this feature is enabled, the pin information is saved in the file set in the next configuration.  
Pinned tags are sorted according to `key` in the frontmatter of `taginfo.md`.

##### Pin information file
We can change the name of the file in which pin information is saved.
This can be configured also from the context-menu.

| Item     | Meaning of the value                                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| key      | If exists, the tag is pinned.                                                                     |
| mark     | The label which is shown instead of `📌`.                                                          |
| alt      | The tag will be shown as this. But they will not be merged into the same one. No `#` is required. |
| redirect | The tag will be redirected to the configured one and will be merged. No `#` is required.          |

##### Disable narrowing down
TagFolder creates the folder structure by collecting combinations of tags that are used in the same note, to make it easier for us to find notes.
When this feature is enabled, collected combinations are no longer structured and show as we have organized them in a manner.


#### Files

##### Display Method

You can configure how the entry shows.

##### Order method

You can order items by:
- Displaying name
- Filename
- Modified time
- Fullpath of the file

##### Use title

When you enable this option, the value in the frontmatter or first level one heading will be shown instead of `NAME`.

##### Frontmatter path
Dotted path to retrieve title from frontmatter.

#### Tags

##### Order method

You can order tags by:
- Filename
- Count of items

##### Use virtual tags

When we enable this feature, our notes will be tagged as their freshness automatically.
| Icon | Edited ...            |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 🕐    | Within an hour        |
| 📖    | Within 6 hours        |
| 📗    | Within 3 days         |
| 📚    | Within 7 days         |
| 🗄    | Older than 7 days ago |

##### Display folder as tag

When we enable this feature, the folder will be shown as a tag.

##### Store tags in frontmatter for new notes

This setting changes how tags are stored in new notes created by TagFolder. When disabled, tags are stored as #hashtags at the top of new notes. When enabled, tags are stored in the frontmatter and displayed in the note's Properties.

#### Actions

##### Search tags inside TagFolder when clicking tags
We can search tags inside TagFolder when clicking tags instead of opening the default search pane.
With control and shift keys, we can remove the tag from the search condition or add an exclusion of it to that.

##### List files in a separated pane
When enabled, files will be shown in a separated pane.

#### Arrangements

##### Hide Items

Configure hiding items.
- Hide nothing
- Only intermediates of nested tags
- All intermediates

If you have these items:
```
2021-11-01 : #daily/2021/11 #status/summarized
2021-11-02 : #daily/2021/11 #status/summarized
2021-11-03 : #daily/2021/11 #status/jot
2021-12-01 : #daily/2021/12 #status/jot
```

This setting affects as like below.
- Hide nothing

```
daily
    → 2021
        → 11
            status
                → jot
                    2021-11-03
                → summarized
                    2021-11-01
                    2021-11-02
                2021-11-01
                2021-11-02
                2021-11-03
            2021-11-01

        2021-11-02
        2021-11-03
        2021-12-01
        → 12
            :
    2021-11-01
    2021-11-02
    2021-11-03
    2021-12-01
```

- Only intermediates of nested tags
Hide only intermediates of nested tags, so show items only on the last or break of the nested tags.
```
daily
    → 2021
        → 11
            status
                → jot

            2021-11-03
        → 12
            :
```
- All intermediates
Hide all intermediates, so show items only deepest.
```
daily
    → 2021
        → 11
            status
                → jot
                    2021-11-03
                → summarized
                    2021-11-01
                    2021-11-02
        → 12
            :
```

##### Merge redundant combinations
When this feature is enabled, a/b and b/a are merged into a/b if there are no intermediates.

##### Do not simplify empty folders
Keep empty folders, even if they can be simplified.

##### Do not treat nested tags as dedicated levels

If you enable this option, every nested tag is split into normal tags.

`#dev/TagFolder` will be treated like `#dev` and `#TagFolder`.

##### Reduce duplicated parents in nested tags

If we have the doc (e.g., `example note`) with nested tags which have the same parents, like `#topic/calculus`, `#topic/electromagnetics`:

- Disabled
```
topic
     - > calculus
         topic
               - > electromagnetics
                   example note
         example note 
```
- Enabled
```
topic
     - > calculus
          - > electromagnetics
              example note
         example note 
```

#### Filters


##### Target Folders
If we set this, the plugin will only target files in it.


##### Ignore Folders

Ignore documents in specific folders.


##### Ignore note Tag

If the note has the tag that is set in here, the note would be treated as there was not.

##### Ignore Tag

Tags that were set here would be treated as there were not.

##### Archive tags
