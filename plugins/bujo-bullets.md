# BuJo Bullets

Alternate checkbox types for Obsidian to support [Bullet Journal bullets](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers).

## Features

- [x] Custom rendering of Bullet Journal styled checkboxes
- [x] Right-click menu to update bullet type

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install BuJo Bullets.

1. Search for "BuJo Bullets" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "BuJo Bullets" under "Community plugins").
5. Start creating bullets in your notes using the [BuJo Bullets syntax](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers).

## Getting Started

BuJo Bullets adds support for the following bullet types:
```markdown
- [-] irrelevant task

```

When in Obsidian's reading mode, the bullets will be displayed using the following icons:

## License

This plugin is released under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file for more information.

Icons are sourced from the Obsidian Minimal theme: https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/blob/8cb709a373c9601a9e9172eaa75fdbeba4412c43/src/scss/app/editor.scss

## Known Issues

- [ ] Copying custom checkboxes from reading mode will not copy the custom bullet type
- [ ] Undo does not work as expected when changing bullet types from the right-click menu
