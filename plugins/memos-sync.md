# Obsidian Memos Sync Plugin

[中文](README-ZH.md) | English

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This plugin provides a few commands to sync memos from a [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server to daily notes in your Obsidian vault. It will also create a daily note if it does not exist.

## Compatibility

This plugin is fully compatible with official [Daily Notes plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes), [Calendar plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) and [Periodic Notes plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes).

This plugin is compatible with each version of Memos API, both for that after v0.22.0 and before.

## Commands

### Sync daily memos

This command will sync memos from the Memos server incrementally to the daily notes.
This plugin will remember the last sync time and only sync memos after that time.

### Force sync daily memos

This command will resync all memos from the Memos server.

### Force sync current daily memos

This command will resync memos from the Memos server for the current daily note that cursor is on.
Useful when you want to sync memos for a specific day.

# FAQ

## Failed to find header for xxxx , Please make sure your daily note tempalte is correct.

This plugin will create a new daily note if it does not exist. 
And it will insert the memos under the header you specified in the configuration.

One possible reason for this error is that the daily note template does not contain the header you specified in the configuration.
So this plugin cannot find the header to insert the memos after creating the daily note.

To fix this, you should make sure the daily note template contains the header you specified in the configuration.
