## Key Promotion
![showcase](https://i.joethei.space/syvxdr4Wd1.gif)

When you use the mouse on a button this plugin will show a notification with the assigned shortcut for that action.

For buttons that don't have shortcuts assigned the plugin
will show you the name of the command to assign in the settings.

> âš  **Buttons are not directly associated with commands in Obsidian.**
> 
> Sometimes even the name of a button does not match the name of the command
> that executes the same action.
> 
> As a result you might get multiple different notifications when pressing one button.

## Description of Actions
