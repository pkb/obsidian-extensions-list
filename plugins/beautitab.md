In addition to the built in themes, you can provide your own images from your local computer (desktop only) or from your vault.

You may also select "transparent" or "transparent with shadows" mode if you would like your theme's background to show through Beautitab.

#### Seasons and holidays (_Recommended_)

This special theme will show diferent images depending on the time of the year. For example, will show fireworks on news years, pumpkins in the fall, and holiday images in December.

#### Custom

Will display a new box to provide the URL to your own image.
