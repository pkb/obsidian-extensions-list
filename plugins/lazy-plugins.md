# Lazy Plugin Loader for Obsidian

Load plugins with a delay on Obsidian startup, so that you can get your app startup down into the sub-second loading time.

**Please note** that it may take up to 2 restarts of Obsidian to see the full speed increase, if it's the first time you're using the plugin. This will only be an issue on the first install.
