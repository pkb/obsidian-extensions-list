`Obsidian Confluence Integration Plugin` is an open-source plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to publish markdown content from Obsidian to [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence). It supports [Obsidian markdown extensions](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes) for richer content and includes a CLI for pushing markdown files from the command line. Currently, the plugin only supports Atlassian Cloud instances.

## Features

- Publish Obsidian notes to Atlassian Confluence
- Support for Obsidian markdown extensions
- CLI for pushing markdown files from disk
- Commands and ribbon icon for easy access

## Issues
Please log issues to https://github.com/markdown-confluence/markdown-confluence/issues as this is where the code is being developed. 

## Getting Started

1. Install the `confluence-integration` plugin from Obsidian's community plugins browser.
2. Open the plugin settings and configure the following fields:

- `Confluence Base URL`: The base URL of your Atlassian Confluence instance (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`)
- `Confluence Parent Id`: The Confluence page ID where your notes will be published as child pages
- `Atlassian User Name`: Your Atlassian account's email address
- `Atlassian API Token`: Your Atlassian API token. You can generate one from your [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
- `Folder To Publish`: The name of the folder in Obsidian containing the notes you want to publish (default: "Confluence Pages")

### connie-publish Frontmatter

To publish pages outside the `folderToPublish`, add the `connie-publish` YAML frontmatter to your notes:

```yaml
---
connie-publish: true
---
```

### Example Workflow
1. Install and configure the `confluence-integration` plugin.
2. Create a folder in your Obsidian vault named "Confluence Pages" (or the folder name you specified in the settings).
3. Add notes to this folder or add the connie-publish frontmatter to other notes.
4. Click the cloud icon in the ribbon or use the "Publish All to Confluence" command to publish your notes to Confluence.
