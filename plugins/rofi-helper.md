# Rofi Helper

This plugin adds a leaf id parameter to the URI protocol for switching between open obsidian tabs with Rofi. A sample Rofi script is included.

The plugin adds URI params for id, and filename. They can be used like this:

```
obsidian://switch?vault=myvault&id=43ee39f0a20b097a

obsidian://switch?vault=myvault&filename=Today.md
```

A sample script `obsidian-rofi.py` is included. It can be used with [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) like the following examples:

```
# Just switch Obsidian tabs
rofi -modi "obsidian:./obsidian-rofi.py" -show obsidian

# Show all desktop windows as well as Obsidian tabs in the same list of options
rofi -modes combi -show combi -show-icons -combi-modes "window,obsidian:./obsidian-rofi.py"

# Show desktop windows and tabs in different pages (switch with Ctrl+Tab)
rofi -modes "window,obsidian" -show window -show-icons -modi "window,obsidian:./obsidian-rofi.py"
```

This is what switching tabs can look like from a global shortcut in your desktop environment:

This has only been tested on linux.


# How it works

The `workspace.json` file contains the the nested structure of all your open windows, tabs, and panes. Sometimes you may even have the same file open in multiple places. Luckily the "id" associated with each "leaf" is unique. 

Here's a snippet from a workspace.json:

```json
{
  "main": {
    "id": "72987848c4af5ae2",
    "type": "split",
    "children": [
      {
        "id": "58d9b585d8e1dcfc",
        "type": "tabs",
        "children": [
          {
            "id": "43ee39f0a20b097a",
            "type": "leaf",
            "state": {
              "type": "markdown",
              "state": {
                "file": "Today.md",
                "mode": "source",
                "source": false
              }
            }
          },
```

We have "Today.md" in the first window, in the first tab, and it's unique leaf id is "43ee39f0a20b097a".

For a vault name of "myvault", you can switch to this tab with the URI command

```
obsidian://switch?vault=myvault&id=43ee39f0a20b097a
```

The `obsidian-rofi.py` python script will generate options for Rofi to use, including ROFI_INFO data like `\0info\x1f43ee39f0a20b097a`.

Example data fed to Rofi:

```

After making your selection, Rofi will exit and the URI command is called with xdg-open.

# Getting the script working with rofi

In the included sample script `obsidian-rofi.py` set these two variables with your personal settings:
```
vault_name = 'my-vault'
vault_path = '/home/my-name/my-files/my-vault'
```

If you run this script locally `python obsidian-rofi.py` it should print a list like shown in the previous section like
```
Today.md                          Window #1   Tab #1 \0info\x1f43ee39f0a20b097a
BalanceQuoteStumble.md            Window #1   Tab #2 \0info\x1fabc2e775384ee4bd
ServiceDoorShield.md              Window #1   Tab #3 \0info\x1fbbd04ae750429c70
MadFemaleRequire.md               Window #1   Tab #4 \0info\x1f869f278435d06213
NuclearBachelorDolphin.md         Window #1   Tab #5 \0info\x1ff7382c4f782e3a96
...
```

Next you should `chmod +x obsidian-rofi.py` since it will be called by rofi like a script.

Confirm you get the same output from the program by running `./obsidian-rofi.py`. You might need to adjust the `#!/bin/python` shebang.

Finally some different examples of rofi commands are provided in the previous sections. Ensure the python script is located in a folder in your path (check `echo $PATH`) for them to work.
