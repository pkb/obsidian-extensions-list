# Nothing
![Obsidian Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=obsidian&color=%23483699&label=downloads&query=%24%5B%22obsidian-nothing%22%5D.downloads&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fobsidianmd%2Fobsidian-releases%2Fmaster%2Fcommunity-plugin-stats.json&style=plastic)

This plugin adds a command that literally does nothing.

**WAIT, before you stop reading: this plugin still has a real use case!** It
allows you to disable system-hotkeys by mapping them to the `Do Nothing`
command. You can, for example, disable the `âŒ˜Q` hotkey on macOS to avoid
accidentally quitting Obsidian.
