# AidenLx's Folder Note

Add description, summary and more info to folders with folder notes.

alx-folder-note is a maintained, completely rewritten, and improved folder note plugin that covers all core features of the original [folder note plugin](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin)) (except folder overview), with enhanced file explorer patches and lots of QoL improvements, aiming to make the folder with note work as seamless as native files.)

Special thanks to [xpgo](https://github.com/xpgo), the author of original [folder note plugin](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin)!
