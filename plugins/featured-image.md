## Introduction

Featured Image is a plugin for Obsidian that automatically sets a **featured image** property in the Frontmatter section of your notes based on the first image, YouTube link, or [Auto Card Link](https://github.com/nekoshita/obsidian-auto-card-link) image found in your document.

This allows you to create rich note lists similar to what you see in other popular note taking applications such as [Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [Bear](https://bear.app/).

### Using Bulk Update Commands

Featured Image provides two powerful bulk update commands to manage featured images across your entire vault:

1. **Set featured images in all files**
   - This command scans all markdown files in your vault, and sets or updates the featured image property based on the first image or YouTube link found in each file.
   - The original modification dates of your files are preserved.
   - To use:
     1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
     2. Search for "Featured Image: Set featured images in all files"
     3. Select the command and confirm the action in the modal that appears

2. **Set featured images in current folder**
   - This command scans all markdown files in the current folder and its subfolders, and sets or updates the featured image property based on the first image or YouTube link found in each file.
   - The original modification dates of your files are preserved.
   - To use:
     1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
     2. Search for "Featured Image: Set featured images in current folder"
     3. Select the command and confirm the action in the modal that appears

3. **Remove featured images from all files**
   - This command removes the featured image property from the frontmatter of all markdown files in your vault.
   - The original modification dates of your files are preserved.
   - To use:
     1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
     2. Search for "Featured Image: Remove featured images from all files"
     3. Select the command and confirm the action in the modal that appears

### Creating Note Lists with Previews

You can use Featured Image in combination with other plugins like [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes) to create beautiful lists of your notes:

1. Ensure your notes have featured images set.
2. Create a new note for your list, for example using the [Folder Notes plugin](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes).
3. Use [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) to generate a list view of your notes, including the featured image as a preview.

Here is an example Dataview query for a list with previews that also shows the subfolders of your notes.
I have chosen to include a Frontmatter property called "foldernote" in my folder notes so they are not shown in the list.

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(file.ctime, "yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Date", regexreplace(file.folder, ".*\/([^\/]+)$", "$1") as "Folder", embed(link(feature)) as Image
FROM ""
WHERE contains(file.folder, this.file.folder)
WHERE file.name != this.file.name
WHERE !contains(foldernote, true)
SORT file.ctime DESC
```

## Settings

Here are the settings for the Featured Image plugin:

1. **Show Notifications**
   - Default: `false`
   - Description: When enabled, the plugin will show notifications when featured images are set, updated, or removed.
   - Usage: Enable this if you want to receive visual feedback when the plugin makes changes to your notes.

2. **Excluded Folders**
   - Default: `[]`
   - Description: List of folders to exclude from processing.
   - Usage: Add folder paths (e.g., `templates`, `archive`) to prevent the plugin from processing files in these locations. To add subfolders, use the full path (e.g., `templates/my-subfolder`).

3. **Frontmatter Property**
   - Default: `feature`
   - Description: The name of the frontmatter property used to store the featured image path.
   - Usage: Change this if you want to use a different property name in your frontmatter.

4. **Media Link Format**
   - Default: `plain`
   - Description: Choose how to format the featured image property in frontmatter:
     - `Plain text`: Stores the path as-is (e.g., `path/to/image.png`)
     - `Wiki link`: Stores the path as a wiki link (e.g., `[[path/to/image.png]]`)
     - `Embedded link`: Stores the path as an embedded link (e.g., `![[path/to/image.png]]`)
   - Usage: Choose the format that best suits your needs and workflow. Plain text is the most portable, while wiki and embedded links integrate better with Obsidian's linking system.

5. **Only Update if Frontmatter Property Exists**
   - Default: `false`
   - Description: When enabled, the plugin will only update notes that already have a featured image property.
   - Usage: Enable this if you want to manually control which notes have featured images.

6. **Keep Empty Property**
   - Default: `false`
   - Description: When enabled, the frontmatter property will be kept but set to an empty string if no featured image is found.
   - Usage: Enable this if you want to preserve the frontmatter property even when there's no featured image.

7. **Require Exclamation Mark for YouTube Thumbnails**
   - Default: `true`
   - Description: When enabled, YouTube links must be prefixed with `!` to be considered for featured images.
   - Usage: Keep this enabled if you want more control over which YouTube links become featured images.

8. **Download WebP**
   - Default: `true`
   - Description: When enabled, the plugin will attempt to download WebP format thumbnails for YouTube videos.
   - Usage: Disable this if you prefer JPG thumbnails or if you're experiencing issues with WebP images.

9. **Thumbnail Download Folder**
   - Default: `thumbnails`
   - Description: The folder where external images, YouTube thumbnails, and Auto Card Link images will be downloaded and stored. To set a subfolder, use the full path (e.g., `_resources/thumbnails`).
   - Usage: Set this to your preferred location for storing downloaded images. The plugin will automatically create subfolders:
     - `youtube/` for YouTube thumbnails
     - `external/` for external images
     - `autocardlink/` for Auto Card Link external images

10. **Image Extensions**
    - Default: `["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "webp"]`
    - Description: List of image file extensions to consider when searching for featured images.
    - Usage: Add or remove extensions based on the image types you use in your vault.

## Benefits and Optimizations

Featured Image is designed with efficiency and performance in mind:

1. **Smart Caching**: The plugin utilizes Obsidian's built-in caching system to quickly access file metadata, minimizing the need for repeated file reads and improving processing speed.

2. **Optimized Document Scanning**: A combined regex is used to match various image formats, external URLs, YouTube links, and Auto Card Link images in a single pass, reducing the number of regex operations to just one, improving efficiency.

3. **Intelligent Image Handling**: 
   - For external images: Downloads and caches them locally for offline access
   - For YouTube links: Attempts to download WebP thumbnails first (if enabled), falling back to different types of JPG formats
   This ensures the best quality images while minimizing bandwidth usage.

4. **Customizable Processing**: Exclude specific folders and choose to only update existing featured images, providing flexibility and further optimization based on individual needs.

## Known Issues

### Conflicts with Mousewheel Image Zoom Plugin

There is a known issue in the plugin "Mousewheel Image Zoom" when the same image name appears multiple times in a document. The following examples will not get resized:

1. When an image is mentioned in text and then used as a link:
   ```markdown
   Some text mentioning example.jpg in a paragraph
   Another paragraph

   ![[example.jpg|100]]  # This link would not get resized
   ```

2. When an image is used in frontmatter and then in the document:
   ```markdown
   ---
   feature: example.jpg
   ---
   ![[example.jpg|100]]  # This link would not get resized
   ```

#### Recommended Workaround
The "Image Converter" plugin offers similar functionality and has fixed this issue in version 1.2.20. Until the Mousewheel Image Zoom plugin is updated, we recommend:

1. Switch to using the "Image Converter" plugin
2. Ensure you're using version 1.2.20 or later of Image Converter

The author of Mousewheel Image Zoom has been notified of this issue, but no fix has been implemented yet.
