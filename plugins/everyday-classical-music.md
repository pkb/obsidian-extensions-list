# Everyday Classical Music Plugin

The **Everyday Classical Music Plugin** for Obsidian introduces a different piece of classical music each day with a YouTube link in your daily notes. They are the first 366 pieces (randomized) recommended by [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18t_9MHZTENbmYdezAAj4LRM0-Eak_MYO1HssZW2FX1U/edit).


## Features (v1.0.0)

- Automatically adds a classical music piece to newly created daily notes.
- Fetches music pieces from a curated list based on the date, ensuring the same suggestion for the same date in different years.
- Provides an option to backfill all existing daily notes with music links.
- Allows removal of music links added before a specified date.
