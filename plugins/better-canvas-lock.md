# Better canvas lock

Experimental plugin for Obsidian, that lock the "view" of canvas. You can disable:
- Zoom
- Selection of canvas 
- Drag and drop of canvas
- Scroll

It will monkey-patch the lock function using `monkey-around`, so you just need to enable the plugin to make it work. Also, canvas are detected on the `active-leaf-change`. 

You can also enable/disable the logs in the console. Beware, because the logs spam the console, and you will see redondant error.

> [!NOTE]
> For some "usefulness", the dragging / scrolling is enabled when a canvas card is focused, so you can move freely the canvas and adjust the view (SHIFT+2) on a specific card if you need. 
> To disable again the dragging, just click away (or escape) from the canvas card.
