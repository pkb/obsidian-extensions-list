[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to display double colon (i.e.

## Editing View

Double colon conceal for editing view is turned off by default. Turn it on in
the plugin settings if you wish to use it. When active the double colons will be
concealed in the live preview as well.

![Editing view example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msrch/obsidian-double-colon-conceal/master/example-editing-view.gif)

Double colon is not concealed:

- on active line (line where cursor is placed)
- within text selection
- in Source mode

Concealed double colon (single colon) has `.cm-double-colon-conceal` CSS class
attached that could be used to add custom styling. Red text colour was used
bellow for demonstration.
