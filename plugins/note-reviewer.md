# Note Reviewer Plugin 

This plugin is designed to help retain knowledge by filtering and fetching notes based on Tags.

### To Use

Once enabled, this plugin will create an icon on the Obsidian side bar. Click the Note Reviewer icon to review your notes.

When you have finished reviewing your note, select the done checkbox on that note to mark it as reviewed. 

### Tags

If you want your note to be grouped and filterable by a particular `Tag` you must include the following snippet somewhere in the top **10 lines** of your note.

```
Tags: [[Tag 1]] | [[Tag 2]]
```

This will automatically be detected by the plugin and allow searching your note via the `Filter` dropdown from the Notification Dashboard.
