# 3D Embed Plugin - How to use

## 1. Showing all filetypes in obsidian:
Go to the settings tab of obsidian -> 'Files and Links' -> toggle the 'Detect all file extensions'

This allows you to see every type of file in your obsidian vault, including 3D model files such as stl. 

## 2. Watch this video that showcases how to use the plugin:

## 3. Or read these images and text:
3.1) Drag Model from file overview/manager into note as an embed

3.2) position cursor on line with 3D model embed

3.3) On line with embed execute the embed 3D command (ctrl+p) -> embed 3D: 3DModel

3.4) Voila a 3D model

# Additional Information
## Example Codeblock
Look at the codeblock to alter minor things in the scene. It shows all the config options of a 3D scene for now
```js
```3D
{
"name": "Castle.glb",
"showGuiOverlay": false,
"rotationX": 0, "rotationY": 0, "rotationZ": 0,
"AutorotateX": 0, "AutorotateY":0.001, "AutorotateZ": 0,
"positionX": 0, "positionY": 0, "positionZ": 0,
"scale": "0.5",
"stlColorHexString": "606060",
"backgroundColorHexString": "7abbd6",
"orthographic": false,
"camPosXYZ": [0,5,10],
"LookatXYZ": [0,0,0],
"showAxisHelper": false, "length": 5,
"showGridHelper": false, "gridSize": 10
}
'''
```

## Standard Settings
Use the settings tab, to alter standard settings such as background color, size of 3D embed, or scale of the model.

## Precautions:
1) Currently only two 3D embeds in one note are (stabily) supported at the same time. (You can possibly attempt more, but no guarantee it works well)
2) Big models will be laggy, since obsidian has a limited amount of RAM that cannot be altered.
3) If your model is not showing up in the scene, half of the time the scale of the model is the cause, so try playing around with sizes both large and small. 

## Future plans:
1) Use one renderer instead of a new renderer with introduction of a new model. (Uncertain of achievability)
2) Introduce more model types support
3) Load textures in 3D models
4) Load multiple objects in one scene
5) Be able to run custom three.js script for a scene. 
6) Add transform controls
