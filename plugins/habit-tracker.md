# Habit Tracker plugin for Obsidian

Visualise your Habits based on DataViewJS in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Use:

1. Annotate the data you want to track in your daily notes (see [Dataview annotation documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/)) 
2. Create a [DataviewJS block](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) wherever you want the Habit Tracker to display.  
3. Collect the data you want to display using [DataviewJS](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/)
4. Pass the data into Habit Tracker using  **renderHabitTracker()**
