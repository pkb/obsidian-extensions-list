\* On macOS, replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd` and `Alt` with `Opt`

### Important notes

- `Ctrl` + `Enter` for 'Insert line below' may conflict with the default shortcut for _Open link under cursor in new tab_; changing/removing one of the bindings is recommended.
- `Ctrl` + `L` for 'Select line' may conflict with the default shortcut for _Toggle checkbox status_; changing/removing one of the bindings is recommended.
- `Ctrl` + `D` for 'Select word or next occurrence of selection' will behave differently depending on how the initial selection was made. If it was also done via `Ctrl` + `D`, the command will only look for the entire word in subsequent matches. However, if the selection was done by hand, it will search within words as well.
- 'Toggle case of selection' will cycle between uppercase, lowercase and title case.
- If you are looking for the `Alt` + `Up` and `Alt` + `Down` shortcuts from VS Code, you can assign those hotkeys to Obsidian's built in actions "Move line up" and "Move line down".

### Multiple Cursors

Most\* of these shortcuts work with [multiple cursors](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Multiple+cursors). However, undo and redo will not work intuitively in Live Preview â€“ actions will be handled individually for each cursor, rather than grouped together. Work is underway to incrementally migrate them to the newer Obsidian editor API so they are grouped, and has been completed for the following:

- Insert line above
- Insert line below
- Delete line

As a workaround, you can also switch back to the legacy editor in Settings as all actions will be grouped in that case.

\* These shortcuts currently do not support multiple cursors:

- Expand selection to quotes or brackets
- Go to next/previous heading
