# Obsidian Location Plugin

[![Build](https://github.com/aaronczichon/obsidian-location-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/aaronczichon/obsidian-location-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Welcome to the Obsidian Location Plugin! This plugin allows you to generate location images for your Obsidian notes. You can create a map image of a specific location.

You can simply use the code block with `location` as the language identifier. If you provide then longitude and latitude, the plugin will generate a map image for that location. If you provide a search term the plugin will fetch the most relevant result and generate a map image for that location.

## Example Usage - using coordinates

\```location  
Latitude: 44.64266326577057  
Longitude: -63.57530151565183  
\```

Or
\```location  
[44.64266326577057, -63.57530151565183]  
\```

This is how it looks rendered:

## Example Usage - using search term

\```location  
search: 123 smith street fitzroy  
\```
