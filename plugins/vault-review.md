# Obsidian Vault Review

This plugin allows you to create a snapshot of your vault and randomly review files from it 1-by-1.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SashaKryzh/obsidian-vault-review/HEAD/preview.png)

Features:

- To create a snapshot, open plugin settings.
- To update file review status use commands, ribbon or status bar (desktop).
- In settings you will find statistics about your review progress.

Planned:

- Support not only .md files.

## Use case

You have a lot of notes and you want to review/clear them. This plugin will create a snapshot
of your vault (mark all existing notes as "to review") and then you can open them
in random order and review (mark as "reviewed" or delete) one by one.

New notes will not be added to the snapshot automatically, but you can do it manually.
