# Short links

An [Obsidian plugin](https://obsidian.md/) to display short [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link).

## Overview

Internal links to **files**, **notes**, **headings**, and **blocks** can be shortened. There are various configuration options to adjust how this is applied. In addition, icons can be displayed at the start or end of links to indicate their type.

This plugin updates the behaviour in both the **editing (live preview)** and **reading view**. This a temporary plugin, that will not be needed if the [feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/option-to-display-heading-without-note-title-in-internal-links/22253) is implemented.

Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottwillmoore/obsidian-short-internal-links-to-headings) if you find any problems with the plugin, or have any suggestions or questions.
