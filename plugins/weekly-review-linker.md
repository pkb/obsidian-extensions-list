# Weekly Review Linker

Weekly review linker is a fork of the weekly review plugin. Instead of opening all the notes created in the past week it makes a file that links all those notes. This helps a lot for using periodic notes, as the weekly notes are not conntected in your graph. 


The rest of the plugin in is the same and I do not want to take credit for that, here it is:
