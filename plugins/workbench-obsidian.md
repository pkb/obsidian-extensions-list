## Workbench

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

It allows you to capture thinking from whatever you're currently looking at into a "Workbench" note. Link and embed pages, headers, and blocks, or copy the current line. You can also use alt+click and cmd/windows+alt+click to add content to the workbench.

### Demo:

Note: you may need to double-click when using the click-based features! 

Insert and clear the materials on the workbench:

### Settings
Control the name of the Workbench note, the line prefix for every item added to the workbench, and what alt+click or cmd/windows+alt+click do in the plugin's Settings.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js` and `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/workbench-obsidian/`.
