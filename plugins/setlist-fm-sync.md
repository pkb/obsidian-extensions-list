# Setlist for Obsidian

This project uses the setlist.fm API to sync the concerts you've attended to a file in Obsidian with date-specific backlinks. It also adds a backlink for the city, if you want to keep track of cities you've been to.

You'll need to [bring your own API key](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html).

## Example

You open up the command palette and run the **Sync attended concerts** command. It then fetches data and places it in a file called `Setlist Concerts Attended.md` in a bulleted list.

```md
- Saw **Andrew Bird** play at *The Rooftop at Pier 17* in [[New York]] on [[2024-08-16]]
- Saw **San Fermin** play at *Racket* in [[New York]] on [[2024-04-05]]
- Saw **Darlingside** play at *Music Hall of Williamsburg* in [[Brooklyn]] on [[2022-05-08]]
- Saw **Valley** play at *Irving Plaza* in [[New York]] on [[2022-02-18]]
```

This plugin could use your feedback and help to make it a success!
