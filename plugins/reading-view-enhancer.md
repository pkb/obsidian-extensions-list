# Reading View Enhancer Plugin

The Reading View Enhancer is an Obsidian plugin designed to improve the reading experience in Obsidian's reading view mode.
It provides several features aimed at making the reading view more convenient and comfortable.

## Features

### Overview

- **Keyboard block navigation**
  - Select the next block
  - Select the previous block
- **Toggle collapse with keyboard**
  - Toggle collapse
	- 📌 Collapsible callouts can also be handled
- **Auto-select top block on switching into reading view** 
- **Always-visible collapse indicators**
  - Keep all collapse indicators visible
- **Right side collapse indicator** (experimental)
- **Scrollable code blocks**
  - Make code blocks scrollable instead of line-wrapping

### Keyboard Block Navigation

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Enable Block Selector

Inspired by Notion's block navigation, this feature allows you to select blocks
in the reading view by pressing keyboard. Selected blocks will be highlighted.

- Default key binding
	- `ArrowDown | j`: Select the next block
	- `ArrowUp | k`: Select the previous block

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a selected block is too long, the plugin will automatically scroll to display
> the block's top or bottom, loading adjacent blocks that are not yet in the DOM tree.

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally, there is a `Select top block in the view` command,
> which allows you to assign a hotkey for keyboard control.

#### What is a "Block"?

In this plugin, a "block" refers to an HTML element that can be
considered a distinct content unit within a markdown document.

Paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, code blocks, quotes, media elements,
and callouts are examples of blocks.

#### Block Color

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Block color

You can set a custom color and transparency for the block highlight effect.

### Toggle collapse with keyboard

When a block is selected and collapsible, you can use your keyboard to toggle collapse. 

- Default key binding
	- `ArrowLeft | h | ArrowRight | l`: Toggle collapse

### Auto-select top block on switching into reading view

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Auto-select top block

When you switch to reading view, the top block will be automatically selected.

### Always-visible Collapse Indicators

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Always on collapse indicator

By default, collapse indicators are invisible until hovered over.  
This option keeps indicators always visible.

### Right side collapse indicator (experimental)

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > [Experimental] Collapse indicator on the right side

Set collapse indicators to be shown on the right side.

> [!WARNING]
> Since this makes some elements relative that were previously not, may lead some problems.

### Scrollable Code Blocks

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Scrollable code

This feature makes code blocks scrollable in reading view,
rather than using line-wrapping.

By default, codes get line-wrapped when it's too long.  
With this option, you can make code blocks scrollable instead of line break.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is for reading view. For the editor,
> install "Style Settings" plugin and set the code block to scrollable.
