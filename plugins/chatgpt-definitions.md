# ChatGPT Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin adds a command to Obsidian that allows you to generate text using the OPENAI GPT-3 API.

## Usage

After adding your API Key to the settings, you can use the command `ChatGPT: Generate Definiton` to generate a definition for a given topic.

It will use the title of the file and the provided tags as the prompt for the API and it will append the generated text to the end of the file.

After the text is generated, the status will be updated to "Definition by AI" or another status that you can configure in the settings.
