## Overview

The Mesh AI plugin emulates the functionality provided by the [Fabric tool](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) within your Obsidian vault. This plugin allows users to run and manage multiple text processing patterns on their notes, the clipboard, or Tavily search results. It integrates with various AI services and platforms to enhance your productivity within Obsidian.

## Features

- **Process Active Note, Clipboard, or Tavily Search Results:** The plugin allows you to apply patterns to the currently active note, clipboard content, or results from Tavily search.
  
- **Pattern Processing:**
  - **Sequential Mode (Default):** Process multiple patterns in order, where the output of the first pattern is used as the input for the next.
  - **Pattern Stitch Mode:** Process multiple patterns and output the results of each pattern collectively.

- **YouTube Link Detection:** Automatically detects YouTube links, fetches their transcripts, and uses the transcripts as a source input for processing.

- **Workflow Creation:** Create workflows from the settings view, which can then be added as command palette items for quick access.

- **Pattern Management:**
  - Download patterns from the Fabric repository.
  - Maintain a custom pattern folder to manage your own patterns.

- **AI Service Integration:** Utilize various major providers such as:
  - `openai`
  - `google`
  - `microsoft`
  - `anthropic`
  - `grocq`
  - `ollama`
