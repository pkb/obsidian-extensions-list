# XMind Viewer

XMind Viewer is a simple plugin for Obsidian that allows you to view XMind files directly 
within your Obsidian vault. This plugin handles opening files with the .xmind extension and 
creates a new XMind viewer for that file.
**Note that an internet connection is required for the plugin to function.**

## Features

- **Open .xmind files**: View XMind files directly in Obsidian.
- **Embed in Markdown notes**: View embedded .xmind files within Markdown notes.
- **View-only functionality**: Provides view-only access with no editing capabilities.

## Installation

1. **Copy the plugin files**: Place the plugin files into the `.obsidian/plugins/xmind-viewer/` 
   directory in your Obsidian vault. Alternatively, you can download and install it from Obsidian under Community plugins.
2. **Enable the plugin**: Go to Obsidian settings (Settings â†’ Community plugins) and activate XMind Viewer.

## Usage

Simply open a `.xmind` file within your vault, and the plugin will automatically render its contents for viewing.
