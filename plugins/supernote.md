# Supernote Obsidian Plugin

I use my Supernote for capturing hand written notes and reading documents.

But, I already use Obsidian for organizing and capturing all of my digital notes.

This plugin enables me (and now you!) to import handwritten notes into Obsidian and view them on a desktop, phone or tablet.

This plugin has three main features:

- üìù View Supernote `*.note` files in your Obsidian Vault. You can link to these notes from your Markdown notes too `[My Note](example.note)`.

- ‚û°Ô∏è  Export Supernote `*.note` files as PNGs and/or markdown files and attach them to your Vault.

- üì∫ Copy an image from a Supernote via [screen mirroring](https://support.supernote.com/en_US/organizing-managing/1791924-screen-mirroring) into your current note with the "Insert Supernote mirror image" command ([demo video](https://youtu.be/Ih_NW-z_aLw))

Thank you to [Tiemen Schuijbroek](https://gitlab.com/Tiemen/supernote) for developing the initial supernote Typescript library I forked.

## FAQ

**Q** Why isn't there a table of contents in the generated Markdown file? 

**A** Because the [Obsidian Outline](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Outline) sidebar accomplishes this same feature.

**Q** Can the images be larger or smaller?

**A** Add a number, in pixels, after a `|` in the link like `![[20240419_100426-0.png|100]]`. [See Obsidian docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files#Embed+an+image+in+a+note). Also, you can use the mouse wheel zoom plugin suggested below to make this easier.
