# Superstition Plugin for Obsidian

Remember: The real productivity hack is sometimes just having a silly reason to not do unnecessary things! 🎎

## What it does

This plugin reimagines the traditional Chinese calendar's "宜/忌" (Suitable/Unsuitable) system as a modern routine management tool.

## How it works

1. Define your activities in the settings
2. Set how often these activities are "permitted" (e.g., once every 7 days)
3. Check daily what's "宜" (recommended) and "忌" (forbidden) for you

For example:
- "Plugin shopping" might be marked as "宜" only once every 14 days
- "Theme switching" could be limited to once every 30 days
- "Folder reorganization" might be blessed only once per month

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins and disable "Safe Mode"
3. Click "Browse" and search for "Superstition"
4. Install and enable the plugin

## Usage

1. Open Settings → Superstition
2. Add your activities and their permitted frequencies
3. Use the command palette and run "Show Today's Routines" to see what's allowed today

## But Remember

如果你今天被标记为"忌：装插件"，那就乖乖等到下次机会吧！
(If today marks "Plugin Installation" as forbidden, just wait for the next blessed day!)
