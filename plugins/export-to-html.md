# Export to HTML for Obsidian
This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) community plugin allows you to export the content of a note as HTML, either to the clipboard or to a new HTML file.

During the export, images will be copied over in base 64 format.

This plugin is a work in progress but it already works great in most cases. Some edge cases with inline image exports will be improved.

Obsidian mobile apps are **not yet supported**.

## Installation
Follow the steps below to install **Obsidian Export to HTML**.

1. Search for *Export to HTML* in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find *Export to HTML* under *Community plugins*).
3. (Optional) If you plan to use it often, in the *Hotkeys* settings, search for *Export to HTML* and bind actions to keyboard shortcuts.

## How to use
Open the command palette (press <key>CTRL+P</key> if you use a keyboard) and type *Export to HTML*.

- Select *Export to HTML: Copy to clipboard as HTML* to copy your note as HTML in your clipboard. You can then paste it in an email or in a Word document and the style will be kept.
