# Simsapa Obsidian Plugin

This is a sub-module repo for [simsapa-extensions-and-plugins](https://github.com/simsapa/simsapa-extensions-and-plugins)

The plugin requires [Simsapa Dhamma Reader](https://simsapa.github.io/) to be installed to work.

![Simsapa Sidebar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simsapa/simsapa-obsidian/HEAD/images/obsidian-sidebar-cittanupassi-screenshot.png)

![Simsapa Word Lookup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simsapa/simsapa-obsidian/HEAD/images/obsidian-word-lookup-cittanupassi-screenshot.png)

Start the Simsapa app, close the main window and let the app stay in the
background. The plugin makes HTTP requests to the application.

When clicking the plugin's icon (book 游늽), the sidebar is opened.

The sidebar can be used to search P캐li dictionaries or suttas.

Double click on a word in a note's text to trigger a dictionary lookup.

- If the sidebar is open, the results are shown there.
- If the sidebar is closed, it should open a _Simsapa Word Lookup_ window with the results (including P캐li accents).

If the _Word Lookup_ does not pop-up, the system may prevent it being opened. In this case:

Open _Word Lookup_ in Simsapa first, move it next to Obsidian, and use double-click on work in your note's text to trigger a lookup. The window should respond by showing the results.
