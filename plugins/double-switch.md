# Double-Switch Plugin

This plugin lets you associate different themes with light and dark mode.

Toggling light or dark mode automatically switches the theme. That's it.

You can pick among the themes you have installed at any time.

# Known issues
Feature interaction:
- In the Obsidian Settings modal dialog for Appearance, you can switch between dark and light mode. While the dialog is open, the theme name does not update even though a theme change happens as expected based on your settings for this plugin. If you exit the settings dialog and visit it again, the theme name has indeed updated.
