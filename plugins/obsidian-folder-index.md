## Features

- Automatic index file generation
- Automatic renaming of index files (if you rename the folder)
- Automatic linking of files in the folder
- Alphabetic sorting of files
- Alphabetic sorting of headings
- Rewritten Graph View to show the folder structure, and link them accordingly
- Support for [File Tree Alternative Plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative) (I highly recommend this
  plugin)

### How to use

It's pretty simple. You simply install the Plugin like any other. After this you can click on any folder
to open their index file, if none exists one will automatically be generated for you (You should definitely check out
the settings and toggle the features you like)

From now on you should be able to use folders like they are a normal note!

Folders will also be added to the Graph View by default and link all files that are contained within it :D

#### Manual Indexing

You can also use the ``folder-index-content`` Block processor directly like this:

````
```folder-index-content
```
````

to include the content of the folder index in any note you want

#### Frontmatter

| Key   | Description                                       |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| title | This will overwrite the Filename inside the Index |

### Manual Installation

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/turulix/obsidian-folder-index/releases) and download the ZIP file from the latest
   release.
2. This ZIP file should be extracted in your Obsidian plugins folder. If you don't know where that is, you can go
   to `Community Plugins` inside Obsidian. There is a folder icon on the right of `Installed Plugins`. Click that and it
   opens your plugin's folder.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file there.
4. Now you should have a folder in plugins called 'obsidian-folder-index' containing a `main.js` file, `manifest.json`
   file, and a `styles.css` file.
