## Obsidian Daily Stats

This is a daily word count plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md). You can see today's word count in the bottom right corner of your screen, and also see the historical logs in a right panel view akin to Github's contribution graph.

This plugin was inspired by liamcain's [Calender](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) and lukeleppan's [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count).
