# Obsidian Pocketbook Cloud Highlights Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) to import highlights that you made on your [Pocketbook E-Ink reader](https://pocketbook.de/), or in the [Pocketbook App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.obreey.reader&hl=de&gl=US) on your phone, using a [Pocketbook Cloud](https://cloud.pocketbook.digital) account.

Requires the "dataview" plugin to work correctly - and does not check that it's installed ;-). Only works for "login with password".

## How it works

It will

- read all highlights from your pocketbook account
- dump them into small markdown files with yaml frontmatter
- create dataview queries to grab all comments together

## Setup

After installing, go to the settings page:

![settings page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenalebt/obsidian-pocketbook-cloud-highlight-importer/HEAD/docs/settings-page.png)

You need to fill your user name. After that, click "Log in" to start the login process.
This will ask you for a password, but the password will not be saved (a refresh token will be, though).

In case you have multiple shops under your pocketbook account, you can fill the "Shop name" you want to use (substring of the name is enough).
The "Import Folder" is where your highlights will be saved to.

## Usage

After setup, you can find the pocketbook cloud highlight import in the command palette.

## License

It's AGPL-3.0 licensed, since the used library "epub-cfi-resolver" is AGPL-3.0. I would have made it ISC-licensed otherwise.
