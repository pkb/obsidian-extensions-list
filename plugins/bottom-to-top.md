# Bottom to Top
While the plugin is turned on, pressing enter adds a new line above the current one instead of below. 

Use the command "Reverse Lines in Current Note" to reverse all lines of text in the current note.

Use the commands "Turn On/Off Reverse Mode in Current Note" to toggle reverse behavior on a note-by-note basis.
