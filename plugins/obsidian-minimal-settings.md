## Overview

This plugin accompanies [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal), allowing you to customize the theme from the Obsidian Settings panel. This plugin is not required to use Minimal Theme, but highly recommended.

Support the development of my plugins and themes **@kepano** on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/kepano) or [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kepano).
