## Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click Browse and search for "Post Webhook"
4. Install the plugin
5. Enable the plugin in your Community Plugins list

## Usage

### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Open plugin settings
2. Add one or more Webhook endpoints
3. Choose whether to append responses to your notes

### Sending Content

#### Full Notes
1. Open any note
2. Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)

### YAML Frontmatter Support

The plugin automatically parses YAML frontmatter and includes it in the Webhook payload. Example note:

```yaml
---
title: My Note
tags: [Webhook, automation]
category: tech
---
Your note content here...

![attachment.png]
```

Will be sent as:

```json
{
  "title": "My Note",
  "tags": ["Webhook", "automation"],
  "category": "tech",
  "content": "Your note content here...\n\n![attachment.png]",
  "filename": "note.md",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "name": "attachment.png",
      "type": "png",
      "size": 12345,
      "data": "base64_encoded_data..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attachment Support

The plugin automatically:
- Detects attachments referenced in your notes using the `![[filename]]` syntax
- Reads the attachment files
- Converts them to Base64
- Includes them in the Webhook payload
- Supports images and other file types

### Response Handling

The plugin can automatically insert Webhook responses into your notes:

1. Enable "Attach Response" in webhook settings
2. When sending a note/selection, any response will be inserted:
   - For full notes: Appended at the bottom
   - For selections: Inserted after the selected text
