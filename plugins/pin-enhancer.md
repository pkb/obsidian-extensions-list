# Obsidian Pin Enhancer

Enhances standard pin functionality by preventing pinned tabs from being closed.

## Features

-   Prevents pinned tabs from being closed with middle-click
-   Adds alternative commands for the user to rebind standard hotkeys for close commands to

**DOES NOT**
- 	Block the context menu close buttons (might consider in the future, but for now it is an easy way to close pinned tabs)
- 	Have all alternative keybinds for close commands (does not have "Close this tab group", Close others in tab group")

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `.obsidian/plugins` folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sheeplet1/obsidian-pin-enhancer.git
```

2. Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin.
3. Bind your close command hotkeys to the alternatives provided. You do not need to unbind the original close commands since the new commands will take priority.
