# Markdown Blogger
This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allows developers to instantly push markdown notes to their local blog, portfolio, or static site project. Works with [Astro.js](https://astro.build), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and any other framework configured to render markdown pages.

Get the benefits of composing markdown notes in Obsidian without having to manually create files and copy-paste content into your local 
project. Also makes it much easier to keep these two files in-sync.

## Features
- **Push** a markdown note to a local project folder (Obsidian -> Project)
- **Push to custom path**
- **Pull** content from a local project file to a markdown note (Obsidian <- Project)
- **Pull from custom path** 

## Usage
After enabling the plugin, go to Markdown Blogger's settings.
- Set the **Local project folder path**. Must be an **absolute** path.
- For **custom path** commands, **Show hidden folders** can be toggled.

### Commands

#### Push markdown command
Creates or overwrites a file at location `/PROJECT_PATH/<note_name>.md` with the current note's markdown content.
- Open a markdown note in editing mode
- Open the command palette and search "Push markdown"
- If the **Local project folder path** is invalid or does not exist, the note will not be pushed

#### Push to custom path command
Same as Push command but allows you to navigate through your system's folders much like a terminal.
- Open a markdown note in editing mode
- Open the command palette and search "Push to custom path"
- Search and choose folders to navigate to your desired location
- `..` moves up a directory and `Select` will push the md file to the current directory
- If the file already exists, choosing the file name will also push

#### Pull markdown command 
Overwrites the current note's markdown content with the file content at location `/PROJECT_PATH/<note_name>.md`
- Open a markdown note in editing mode
- Open the command palette and search "Pull markdown"
- If the file at location `/PROJECT_PATH/<note_name>.md` is invalid or does not exist, the content will not be pulled

#### Pull from custom path command
Same as Pull command but allows you to navigate through your system's folders much like a terminal.
- Open a markdown note in editing mode
- Open the command palette and search "Pull from custom path"
- Search and choose folders to navigate to your desired location
- `..` moves up a directory and `Select` will pull the md file from the current directory
- Choosing the file name will also pull it into the editor

#### Validate path command
Validates the **Local project folder path** currently in settings.
- Open the command palette and search "Validate Path command"
- A message indicating the validity of the path will be displayed 

## Tips & Disclaimers
1. This is not a Version Control System like Git. Push and pull commands will overwrite the contents of the file. No history is tracked. I recommend only making changes to one file at any given time and pushing or pulling before editing a file.
2. Triple-check your **Local project folder path**. You can easily copy the **absolute** path from within VS Code by right-clicking the directory where you store your `.md` files. 
	- Ex. `/Users/alexa/Desktop/code-projects/alexa-blog/src/content`
3. Files are paired with each other (in Obsidian vs. in Project) based on their filename. As of now, if you change the filename in one place you must change it in the other. 
4. Since the `.md` file in your project will have the same filename as the Obsidian note it was generated from, I recommend using hyphens instead of spaces when naming files.
	- Ex. `Cool Blog Post.md` becomes `Cool-Blog-Post.md`
