# Obsidian Trash Explorer

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that makes it possible to list, restore, and delete files in the _.trash_ folder in your Obsidian vault. This is useful if you're having trouble accessing hidden folders, such as on iOS.

[Install Trash Explorer from Obsidian community plugins.](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-trash-explorer)

## Usage

> **Important:** this plugin works only with Obsidian's own _.trash_ folder. It does not work with the system trash.
>
> To enable this, open the settings and go to _File & Links_, then set _Deleted files_ to _Move to Obsidian trash_.

Click the trash explorer icon in the ribbon or use _Show trash explorer_ from the command palette. Then you can restore or delete files and folders with the buttons in the trash explorer view. It's also possible to delete all trashed files with the _Empty trash_ command.

Items are restored to a vault location matching their location in the trash. For instance, `.trash/Recipes/Belgian waffles.md` will be restored to `Recipes/Belgian waffles.md`, creating any intermediate folders if they don't exist. If the restore path already exists in the vault, the item will not be restored; you'll have to rename the existing file to something else first.

## Limitations

This plugin is at the mercy of where Obsidian places trashed items, as it has no access to their original location. In particular, Obsidian always moves items to the root of the `.trash` folder, regardless of their parent folder structure, so any parent folders will not be preserved when restoring. For instance, trashing the file `Recipes/Belgian waffles.md` will move it to `.trash/Belgian waffles.md`, and restoring it will move it to `Belgian waffles.md` in the root of the vault.

## Development

### UI testing

```sh
# tl;dr
npm install
./e2e-setup.sh /path/to/obsidian.app
npm run e2e
```

Running `npm run e2e` tests the plugin in an actual Obsidian app using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Each Playwright test restores a test vault, launches Obsidian, and performs automated actions to smoke-test the plugin in a real environment.

Before running `npm run e2e`, it's necessary to run `e2e-setup.sh` in a terminal and follow its instructions. The purpose of this script is to create a copy of Obsidian's files that are usable by Playwright as well as to configure Obsidian itself. The script has currently only been tested on macOS - it may or may not work on other operating systems (please make a PR!).

> As for why the setup script is necessary:
>
> It used to be possible to automate the regular Obsidian executable from Playwright, but starting with an Obsidian update in 2024 the app could no longer be launched without timing out. This is likely due to the [EnableNodeCliInspectArguments](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses#nodecliinspect) fuse being disabled, a known issue that's also mentioned in the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron). Flipping Electron fuses in a packaged app changes the app's signature which makes the OS refuse to launch it. This project tries to work around it by extracting the JavaScript source files from the Obsidian app using Electron's ASAR tool, then launch those with Electron itself.
>
> Additionally, the E2E tests rely on a known test vault as the tests do manipulate real files in a real folder. As it's not currently possible to open a vault from the CLI unless Obsidian has previously opened it, it's necessary to manually open the `e2e-vault` in the unpacked Obsidian app before tests can be run against it.
