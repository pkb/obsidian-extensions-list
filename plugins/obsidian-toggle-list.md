# ToggleList Plugin for Obsidian

ToggleList is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that provides an alternative way to toggle checkbox status and allows for easy toggling between frequently used attributes such as task states, task tags, highlighted lists, and more. This simple plugin overwrites the default toggle behavior in Obsidian, making it more customizable and user-friendly.


## Plugin Features

ToggleList provides the following features:

1. Hotkey toggling of list states within a state group:
	- For example, a state group might include the following states: [`""`, `- `, `- [ ] `, ` - [x] `]

2. Multiple state groups for different purpose
	- Task group: [`- [ ] `, ` - [/] `, ` - [x] `]
	- Highlight group: [`- [i] `, ` - [!] `, ` - [?] `]

3. Prefix and Suffix Support. State `Prefix||Suffix` can match `Prefix line contents Suffix`.
	- Timestamp can be used in both **Prefix** and **Suffix**  using {time:: time-format}, e.q. {time:: YYYY-MM-DD}. Supported time format can be found in [Supported Time Format](https://github.com/thingnotok/obsidian-toggle-list/blob/master/doc/time_format.md).
	- Use cases
		- Task created / completed: `- [ ] || ➕[[{time:: YYYY-MM-DD}]]` / `- [ ] || ✅ {time:: YYYY-MM-DD}` ([Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)' style)
		- [Interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling): `- **{time:: hh:mm}** `


4. Suggestion window: turn on suggestion for commands so the whole state group with show in suggestion window for quick access.

5. States visualization

6. Togglelist works as a handy tool to setup contents in other plugins, check [Working with other Plugins](https://github.com/thingnotok/obsidian-toggle-list/blob/master/doc/other_plugin.md) for more examples

Here's why checkboxes need more states and how to query these customized states:
