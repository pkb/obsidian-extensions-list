# Occura Plugin: highlighting word occurrences

### Why another plugin?
I couldn't find the usual functionality that I used in Notepad++ or different IDEs, where double-clicking on a word immediately showed me how often it appears in the open document.

### Features
#### Release 1.3.0: 
Automatic highlighting of keywords (It works only in Source or Live preview mode!)

New settings has been added

When Occura has highlighted the available occurrences, call the command: **Set permanently highlight for occurrences** and then the occurrences will be highlighted by the regular for Obsidian.md by color

And call the: **Remove permanently highlight for occurrences** command to remove the previously set highlight

#### Release 1.0.0:
Basic functionality

- You simply double-click on a word and see the other occurrences of the word (or the selected part of it) highlighted.

- In the settings, you can specify the highlight color, hotkeys for quickly enabling/disabling the plugin, and the display of the number of matches found in the Status bar.
