Easy Typing is an enhancement plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that improves the writing experience. It includes automatic text formatting and symbol editing enhancements during editing.

## Core Features

1. **Text Auto-formatting**: Capitalizes the first letter and automatically adds spaces between specific parts of each line according to user-defined rules. This feature also includes user-defined regular expression blocks for handling special text formats.

2. **Edit Enhancements**: Includes symbol auto-pairing/deletion, symbol editing enhancement for selected text, continuous full-width symbol to half-width conversion, Obsidian syntax-related editing enhancements, Tabout, code block editing enhancements, and Backspace editing enhancements.

3. **Customizable Conversion Rules**: Supports user-defined conversion rules for various editing scenarios.

4. **Plugin Built-in Commands**: Includes the deletion of extra blank lines, formatting the entire document, formatting the current line/selected area, creating a new line after the current line and jumping (Ctrl+Enter), and toggling comments (supports comments within code blocks, Mod+/).

5. **Experimental Features**: Includes some experimental features, including strict line breaks where Enter inputs two line breaks, automatic punctuation correction (only during input, English punctuation between Chinese is converted to Chinese punctuation), etc.
