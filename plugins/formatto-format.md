designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.

- Click "Format Document" ribbon action


## This plugin works best in "source mode."
Obsidian uses "live preview" as the default editing mode. But this plugin was designed to work best in "source mode." You can change the editing mode here:

- Options -> Editor -> Default editing mode
