# image-ocr

Runs ocr on pasted images and posts result in details box.
This also allows the images to be searchable.

## How to Use
1) Install the 'Local Images Plus' plugin so that all pasted images get copied to a local folder (this plugin uses 'Meta/Attachments/' per default)  
2) Make sure you have tesseract installed:
    1) Head over to https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html and download the installer  
    2) Then add the folder with the tesseract.exe file to the environment variables (or insert the path into the "Tesseract Path" option in the plugin settings)  
    3) Check if tesseract can be run from the command line  

3) Execute the 'Run' command in Obsidian  
4) Enjoy!

Feel free to open issues if you need help setting it up!
