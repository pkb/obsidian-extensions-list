# obsidian-format-with-prettier

Format files in your Obsidian vault using [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

## Installation

Unzip the `format-with-prettier.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/alexgavrusev/obsidian-format-with-prettier/releases/latest) into the `.obsidian/plugins` folder of your vault.

Note that you might have to reopen your vault for the plugin to show up under "Installed plugins"

## Usage

Format on save is enabled by default, and can be changed under plugin settings

Additionally, a "Format current file" [command](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) is available

## Customization

The plugin fill look for a `prettierrc.json` (note the lack of `.` at the start of the file) in the root folder of your vault. In it, you can [configure Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration) as you normally would

## Formatting the entire vault at once

Use the Prettier [CLI](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli):

```console
$ cd YOUR_VAULT_FOLDER
$ echo '**/.obsidian' > .prettierignore
$ npx prettier . --write --config prettierrc.json
```
