## Getting Started

After installing the plugin:

- Go to the plugin configuration and add a feed (under the *Content* section).
- In Obsidian, expand the right hand pane and click the RSS tab.

## Finding the RSS feed for a website

- Search for the RSS logo or a link on the website
- Use an browser addon ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/), [Chrome based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-rss-feed-url/kfghpdldaipanmkhfpdcjglncmilendn))
- Search the websites sourcecode for `rss`

## Tips
- get fulltext content for some truncated RSS feeds with [morss.it](https://morss.it/)
- get feeds from some social media sites with [RSS Box](https://rssbox.herokuapp.com/)
- Filter content from feeds with [SiftRSS](https://siftrss.com/)
- Get an RSS feed for a site that does not support RSS with [RSS-proxy](https://github.com/damoeb/rss-proxy/) or [RSS Hub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub)

## Template variables

## âš  Security
- This plugin contacts the servers that host the RSS feeds you have specified.
- RSS feeds can contain arbitrary data, this data will get sanitized before being displayed.
- Many Obsidian plugins use codeblocks to add some functionality. This plugin sanitizes these codeblocks at read/note creation time. This is to block rss feeds from executing arbitrary plugin code.
- Some plugins allow for different kinds of inline syntax's, these are treated individually (Currently only _Dataview_ and _Templater_).


## Styling
If you want to style the plugin differently you can use the following css classes

- rss-read
- rss-not-read
- rss-filters
- rss-folders
- rss-folder
- rss-feed
- rss-feed-title
- rss-feed-items
- rss-feed-item
- rss-tag
- rss-tooltip
- rss-modal
- rss-title
- rss-subtitle
- rss-content

For help with styling you can also check out the `#appearance` channel on the [Obsidian Members Group Discord](https://obsidian.md/community)
