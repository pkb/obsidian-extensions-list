# üîÆ How to use

### With Command

Since version `1.1.0` you can create plots via a handy GUI with live-preview functionality.

1. Open the command palette and select `Obsidian Functionplot: Plot a Function`

2. Adjust the plot to your liking.

    ![Create plot modal](./images/create-modal/light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
    ![Create plot modal](./images/create-modal//dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

3. This will create a coordinate system with bounds `-10 < x < 10, -10 < y < 10` and plot the functions f and g. If you havent disabled it, you can even drag and zoom the graph.

<!--     ![Graph image](./images/plot/light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
    ![Graph image](./images/plot/dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) -->

### With `functionplot` Block

title: The random graph
xLabel: Time
yLabel: Cost
bounds: [0, 10, 0, 50]
disbaleZoom: 1
