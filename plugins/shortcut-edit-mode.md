# File Header Shortcuts: Edit Modes

Add a button in file header in edit mode, to switch between source & live-preview.

Doesn't work if LP or file header is disabled

I setting, it is possible to create a "three mode toggle", with order. The button will, then, allow to switch between read/source/LP. It will disable the default Obsidian button, obviously.

> [!note]
> It is possible that LP will "blink" when switched with this mode.
