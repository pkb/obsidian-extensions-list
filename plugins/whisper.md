# Speech-to-text in Obsidian using OpenAI Whisper 🗣️📝

Obsidian Whisper is a plugin that effortlessly turns your speech into written notes. Just speak your mind, and let [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) from OpenAI do the rest!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. This plugin can be installed from "Community Plugins" inside Obsidian.
2. For this plugin to work, you will need to provide your OpenAI API key. See the Settings section of this README file for more information.

## 🎯 How to Use

### Access Recording Controls

Click on the ribbon button to open the recording controls interface.

### Record Audio

Use the "Start" button to begin recording. You can pause and resume the recording using the "Pause/Resume" button. Click the "Stop" button once you're done. After stopping the recording, the plugin will automatically transcribe the audio and create a new note with the transcribed content and linked audio file in the specified folder.

> You can quickly start or stop recording using the `Alt + Q` shortcut.

### Upload Existing Audio File

You can also transcribe an existing audio file:

-   Open the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + P`.
-   Search for "Upload Audio File" and select it.
-   A file dialog will appear. Choose the audio file you want to transcribe.
-   The plugin will transcribe the selected file and create a new note with the content and linked audio file in the specified folder.

### Command Palette for Quick Actions

Both "Start/Stop recording" and "Upload Audio File" actions can also be accessed quickly through the command palette.
