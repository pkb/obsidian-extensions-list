# Obsidian Image Magician Plugin

This plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) supports various image formats
not natively supported by the Obsidian app.

With this plugin, you can use various features based on images,
such as preview, link, embed, and export to other image formats like png, jpg, and webp.

This project mainly utilizes [magick-wasm](https://github.com/dlemstra/magick-wasm) to offer rendering and export features.
Especially, a dedicated engine [@webtoon/psd](https://github.com/webtoon/psd) is ready for the psd (Photoshop) format.

## Support

### Seems Broken in ImageMagick

These are listed on Image Magick library. But not works.

| Format | Note                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| TGA    | Truevision Targa image         |
| SVG    | Required inkscape command line |

## Known problems and Tips

### Rendering problems with export markdown as another format

If you plan to export your markdown to another format or encounter rendering problems, it is recommended to change the 'Render Mode' option to 'Data URL'.

### Link suggestion

This issue (or the intended behavior in Obsidian) has been identified in at least Obsidian 1.5.0. You may not see link suggestions when embedding non-obsidian-native images that are not default supported in Obsidian. You can resolve this by turning on 'Settings > File & Links > Detect all file extensions.' Alternatively, you can use a plugin such as [Boost Link Suggestions](https://github.com/jglev/obsidian-boost-link-suggestions).

## Format list in image-magick

The document of image-magick, there are listed various formats (100+),
but as I confirmed some of formats has been incomplete drawing or throw errors.
Therefore, I listed some of formats as default plugin supported that I confirmed that is renders as expected.
