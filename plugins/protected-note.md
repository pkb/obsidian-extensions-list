### Set Password and hide your notes from other people. 🔒

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) let you set any password you want!

**ATTENTION ❗** \
Note that encryption is not enabled by default, and the plugin can be used without it. Also, keep in mind that encryption is still in beta.

**Why do i need that?** \
Imagine you have something private in your notes. Well, you're in luck, because with Protected Note, your secrets are safe! ;D

## Set password 🔑

-   Go to settings > community plugins > protected note > enable password.

## Encrypt and Decrypt 💾

-   Back up your files before enabling encryption to prevent data loss.
-   When you close Obsidian, your files won't be encrypted because Obsidian can't run encryption while closing.
-   To encrypt all your files upon exit, use the ribbon icon.

## Settings (all) ⚙

**Password Protection**: click Enable to set a new password. To Disable the password, click the toggle and verify your identity.

**Protected Folder**: select a specific folder to protect.

**Auto-Lock**: automatically lock Obsidian when you're inactive.

**Animations**: turn this off to remove animations. This will stop the lock emoji animation in the title and the blur transition when you confirm your password.

**File encryption**: Secure your files with AES encryption.

**This plugin will be developed and added new features** 🧬
