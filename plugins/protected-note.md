### Set Password and hide your notes from other people. 🔒

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) let you set any password you want!

**Why do i need that?** \
Imagine that you have something to hide in your notes. Well, you're lucky, because you have protected note ;D

**WARNING ❗** \
Make sure you read the entire documentation, especially about encryption. Remember that it's in beta.

## Set password 🔑

- go to settings > community plugins > protected note and enable password.
- set any password you want on the modal.

## Encrypt and Decrypt 💾

- now you can encrypt all .md files.
- make sure that you have backed up your files before enabling encryption.
- when you exit obsidian, all files won't be encrypted. This happens because obsidian doesn't allow to start the encryption function when you're closing obsidian (_if you know how to encrypt files when you're leaving obsidian help me with code_).
- if you want to encrypt all your files when you leave you can use the ribbon icon.
- encryption was tested on Android and Windows. Be careful if you want to use it on other operating system.

## Settings (all) ⚙

**Disable/enable the password**: if you want to create a new password you, have to click enable. If you want to disable the password you need to verify modal.

**Show animations**: if you enable this settings, you will have animations. First animation is on the title lock emoji. The second one when you confirm your password you can see transition blur

**Auto lock**: enable if you want to block obsidian if you're not active.

**File encryption**: encrypt and decrypt all files using cipher aes.
