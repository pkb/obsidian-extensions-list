# Obsidian Chord Sheets

Render and work with chord sheets (**chords over lyrics** or **inline chords** in brackets) in your vault. This plugin brings
UltimateGuitar-like functionality into Obsidian, featuring **chord diagrams**,
support for **guitar**, **ukulele** and **mandolin**, **transposition**, and **autoscroll**. Works seamlessly in **edit / live preview**
and **reading** mode. It integrates with your **theme colors** and is **customizable** to your needs.

## Features

### ‚ú® Highlight Chord Symbols

Detects and highlights chord symbols in fenced code blocks marked as ```` ```chords````.

![inline-chords.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/inline-chords.png)

*Note:* When copy and pasting a chord sheet from a website, paste as plain text to preserve formatting (per default *‚åò + ‚áß + V* on Mac and *Ctrl + ‚áß + V* on Windows/Linux or right click ‚ûî *Paste as plain text*). 

The plugin auto-detects chord and lyric lines. If it fails, add `%c` at the end of chord lines or `%t` for lyrics (an idea
'borrowed' from the [Chord Lyrics](https://github.com/nevernotmove/obsidian-chordlyrics) plugin):

### üéº Chord Diagrams

Show chord diagrams on hover or on top of a chord block. Provides alternative fingerings for each chord. Diagrams are
rendered locally, no API calls to an external service required.

### üî® Custom Chord Shapes

Define your own chord shapes using brackets: `Bbadd13[x13333]`, `Dm6[4|x2x132]` (with capo), or `C¬∞[x34_242_]`
(with barre).

### üé∏ Choose Your Instrument

Includes chord diagrams for guitar, ukulele and mandolin. The instrument can be set globally or specified per chord block.

### üìù Seamless Editing

Allows seamless editing of chords and lyrics in *live preview / edit* mode while keeping chord symbol
highlighting and chord diagram rendering active, without needing to switch the fenced block to source view. This is
achieved by implementing a CodeMirror editor extension for rendering instead of a code block post processor.

### üîÑ Transpose Songs

Transpose songs up and down with a click or an editor command.

### üìú Autoscroll

Scroll down as you play with configurable speed.

![autoscroll.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/autoscroll.gif)

Save your preferred scroll speed for a note by adding the `autoscroll-speed` frontmatter property. Set it manually or
use the `Save current autoscroll speed` command to add it with the last used speed. The property will update
automatically as you adjust the speed.


### üåà Uses Theme Colors

| Minimal dark                               | Minimal light                                 | AnuPpuccin light                                  |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ![minimal-dark.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/minimal-dark.png) | ![minimal-bright.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/minimal-bright.png) | ![anuppuccin-bright.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/anuppuccin-bright.png) |

To customize colors and styles, use the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. 

### ‚å®Ô∏è Editor Commands

Access all features using dedicated editor commands with support for keyboard shortcuts.

![editor-commands.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olvidalo/obsidian-chord-sheets/HEAD/docs/editor-commands.png)

*Note*: The keyboard shortcuts in the screenshot are just for illustration. Shortcuts are empty by default 
and need to be set in Obsidian settings after installing the plugin. 

### üì±Mobile Support

Works well on mobile. Bring up chord diagram popups by tapping on the chord symbols.
Can be a bit fiddly in _edit / live preview_ mode because tapping on a chord will position the caret 
there which brings up the keyboard. Prefer _reading_ mode on mobile.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurability

* Turn chord or section header **highlighting** on or off 
* Hide certain **UI elements** (instrument and transpose controls, chord diagrams, autoscroll button) for _edit / live preview_ mode, _reading_ mode, or both. 
* Adjust **chord diagram size** and the **default instrument** 
* Customize the block **"language" specifier** (e.g. start a chord block with ```` ```tab````  instead of ```` ```chords````) and the **line markers** (e.g. `[c]` instead of `%c`)
* Integrates with [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) for fine-grained customization of colors and styles

## Development

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

This repo contains **run / debug configurations** for JetBrains IDEs (such as WebStorm). You will
need to adapt the _Run Obsidian_ configuration to the path of your Obsidian installation and set the 
working directory to the path where you cloned this repo.

To start a development and debug session with supports for breakpoints etc.:

1. Run the **Run Obsidian** configuration in **debug** mode. This will start Obsidian with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` parameter which enables
Chrome remote debugging on port 9222.
2. Run the **Debug** configuration which attaches the IDE to Obsidian.
3. Run the **dev** configuration in **debug** mode which starts the development server.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/chord-sheets/` and enable the plugin in Obsidian's settings.

## Credits

This plugin uses:

- [Vexchords](https://github.com/0xfe/vexchords) for rendering chord diagrams.
- [tonal](https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal) for parsing chord symbols, chord normalization and transposition.
- [chords-db](https://github.com/tombatossals/chords-db) for ukulele and guitar fingerings.
