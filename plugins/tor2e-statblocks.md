# The One Ring 2E Statblocks

This plugin renders adversary statblocks for The One Ring, Second Edition.

Many thanks to @ben for creating the [13th Age statblocks plugin](https://github.com/ben/obsidian-13th-age-statblocks) from which this plugin is adapted.

Thanks to @vehrka for their styling contributions.

### Development

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/tor2e-statblocks/`.
  - If you ran `npm run dev`, these will be in the root folder.
  - Pre-built versions of these files can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/modality/obsidian-the-one-ring-2e-statblocks/releases).
- In Obsidian, navigate to Preferences > Community plugins. Toggle `The One Ring 2E Statblocks` on.

### Create a statblock

A statblock may be defined in a note using this syntax. Fields are mostly optional. If the stat block "disappears" it is because there is a field in the wrong format. Try adding fields one at a time.

The parameters in the statblock are parsed as YAML. Certain Obsidian conventions (for example, double brackets: `[[]]`) may not work as YAML has its own interpretation of what this means. Try wrapping these in double quotes `""`.

#### Fields

- `name` - Adversary name
- `blurb` or `description` - The flavor-text description about the adversary.
  - This field is rendered as Markdown: Obsidian links `[[]]` will work here.
- `features` - A list of distinctive features
- `level` - The attribute level of the adversary
- `endurance` - Endurance points
- `might` - Might rating
- `hate` or `resolve` - Use either of these, the right label will appear
- `parry` - Parry rating
- `armour` or `armor` - Armour rating
- `proficiencies` - Combat proficiencies. These are represented by a list of YAML dictionaries in the following format:
  - `name` - The attack name
  - `rating` - The attack rating
  - `damage` - The damage rating
  - `injury` - The injury threshold
  - `special` - Special damage opportunities
    - This field is rendered as Markdown: Obsidian links `[[]]` will work here. If they are not rendering as links, try wrapping the brackets in double quotes.
- `abilities` - A list of Fell Abilities
  - This field is rendered as Markdown: Obsidian links `[[]]` will work here. If they are not rendering as links, try wrapping the brackets in double quotes.
