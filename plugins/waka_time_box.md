# Obsidian WakaTime Box

![](./docs/screenshot.webp)
![](./docs/screenshot_2.webp)

Show your [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) stats in your Obsidian daily notes.

By default, it will fetch periodically every hour, but you can force a refresh from the command palette.

This plugin will insert the stats at the top of the daily note. But if it's existing, it will refresh the stats instead of inserting a new one. You can use this behavior to customize where to insert the stats in your daily note.
