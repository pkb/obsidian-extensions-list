## Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click on Browse and search for "Pixel Banner"
4. Install the plugin and enable it

### Manual Installation
- Unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/releases/latest) into your `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/` folder.

## Usage

1. Obtain a free API key from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/), or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications) (requires account to generate API)
2. In Obsidian, go to Settings > Pixel Banner > API Settings and enter your API key(s)
3. In any note, add a `banner` field to the frontmatter with keywords for the desired image, a direct URL, a path to a local image, or an Obsidian internal link:

```yaml
---
banner: blue turtle
---

### Or use a direct URL:

---
banner: https://example.com/image.jpg
---

### Or use a local image:

---
banner: /path/to/local/image.jpg
---

### Or use an Obsidian internal link:

---
banner: [[path/to/internal/image.jpg]]
---

### All settings can be overridden per note:

---
banner: ocean
banner-y: 30
content-start: 90
banner-display: contain
banner-repeat: true
banner-height: 500
banner-fade: -75
banner-radius: 50
banner-title-color: "#FF5733"
---
```

### Custom Field Names

You can customize the frontmatter field names used for each setting, and even define multiple names for each field. For example, if you set the banner field names to "banner, header-image, cover" and the Y-position field names to "banner-y, y-pos", you could use any 
of these variations in your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
header-image: sunset
y-pos: 22
---

---
banner-y: 60
y-pos: 60
---

---
header-image: sunset
banner-y: 30
---
```

Field names must follow these rules:
- Only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores are allowed
- No spaces within field names (spaces after commas are fine)
- Names must be unique across all fields

### API Settings

In the API settings, you can customize:

- API Provider (Pexels/Pixabay/Flickr/Unsplash)
  - Test your API keys directly in settings with the "Test API" button
  - Get immediate feedback if your API key is valid
- Image size (small, medium, large)
- Image orientation (landscape, portrait, square)
- Number of images to fetch (1-50)
- Show pin/refresh icon
- Default keywords for when no specific keyword is provided

#### Pin API Images

When using random images from images providers, you'll see a pin icon (📌) in the top left corner of the banner. Click this to:
1. Save the image to your vault
2. Update your note's frontmatter to use the local image
3. Never lose that perfect banner image again!

You can configure the save location and manage orphaned pins in settings.

### Folder-Specific Banners

You can set default banner images for entire folders:

1. Go to Settings > Pixel Banner
2. Open "Folder Images" page
3. Click "Add Folder Image Setting"
4. Configure the folder settings:
   - Folder path
   - Enable Image Shuffle option: Randomly select an image from a specified folder each time the note loads
   - Y-position (0-100)
   - Banner height (100-2500 pixels)
   - Fade effect (-1500 to 100)
   - Border radius
   - Inline title color
   - Display mode and repeat settings
   - Direct Children Only: Enable this option to apply the banner settings only to the direct children of the specified folder, excluding subfolders.
5. Repeat for additional folders as needed

Folder-specific settings will apply to all notes in that folder (and subfolders) that don't have their own banner specified in the frontmatter, unless the "Direct Children Only" option is enabled.
