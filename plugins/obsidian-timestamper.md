# Time Stamper - Obsidian Plugin
Add time- or date stamps to your note:
- Two format strings can be pre-configured in the plugin settings (and inserted via command or hot-key)
- An ad-hoc customized time stamp can be inserted via a dialog (last recently used format is saved and provided as suggestion)

Desktop as well as mobile versions of Obsidian are supported.

## Plugin Settings
The plugin comes with some options for configuration:
- A default template string for quick-insert of a time stamp (via command or configurable hot-key)
- A default template string for quick-insert of a date stamp (via command or configurable hot-key)
- An option to specify if a line-break should be added after the inserted time/date stamp automatically

## Hotkey Configuration
Hot-Keys can be configured for in the Obsidian Hotkeys-Options Page for quick access to the following commands:
- Open dialog to enter a custom time/date format string
- Insert pre-defined time stamp
- Insert pre-defined date stamp

## Format String
The plugin uses moment.js which comes with Obsidian by default, hence all known tokens from moment.js can be used to create your customized time/date stamp:
