> so, you can also move files to _another directory_

later on update **Replacement Symbols** those symbols will be used for in a new path.

Click _Search By Tags_

Put tags in **Tags names** field search will be completed across the vault, use coma separator if you need more than 1 tag
Click Refresh
Update **Existing Characters** field with a pattern you are looking for in existing notes, set **Replacement Symbols**

## API
- **folder location** - Files from which folder you need to rename
- **Symbols in existing files** - the symbols/characters that we have in the files
- **Replacement Symbols** - a new symbols that will be pasted instead
- **Files within the folder** - this is for information purpose
- **RegExp pattern** - pattern of RegExp to match
- **RegExp flags** - flags that will be applied to RegExp pattern

Rename Button will start renaming all files by respective path.


## Motivation
This plugin was developed to cover my needs. Originally I've started to use my daily files with **_** delimiter.
So my files looked like this: 2022_01_01, over the time I realized other platform out of the box configured to prefer dashes, like this 2022-01-01

Here is many guides on how to rename files, what kind of script we need to run, what version of python or Node.js we need to install and so on.

Why Not to have this functionality build-in into Obsidian?

And rename a **bunch of files** and update their reference in code base respectively. So now you can rename a bunch of files at once and all imports also will be updated in the vault
