This is a plugin intended to generate you and/or your friend's the same random creative writing prompts.
- While this was designed as a way of connecting multiple peoples prompts algorithmically, this can be used on your own!
- Get creative prompts for writing, composing, illustration, or whatever your creative medium is!
- Set the time increment (in seconds) to allow for different projects or use cases.
- Get a list of all the previous prompts.


### What this plugin does
- Add ribbon button that creates/opens the prompt note.
- Generate three word prompts for creative writing. 
### How to use
**FOR BEST PERFORMANCE, YOUR KEY SHOULD BE 6-9 CHARACTERS LONG**
#### Steps to get started
1. **Go to** `settings` > `community plugins` > `Three Noun Prompts` > `settings`(cog wheel icon)
2. **Create** you're own secret key using **letters only!**
> This is a seed that the algorithm uses to generate the prompt of the day.
> While I have tested out multiple different cases for the secret key, I can not validate everything.  If you do not care about the see, just use `secretkey` or any other random string!
3. **Set** the note title that you want **updated** with the prompts.
4. **Set** the interval (seconds) between the prompts **changing**. 
5. **Save and apply!**
6. **Click** the die icon on the ribbon on the **left.**
> If the note does not **automatically** show up, you might have to **create** a note **manually**.  To do so, just **name** the note your title from the **setting** "Note Title"(2).
7. **Enjoy** your writing prompts!
