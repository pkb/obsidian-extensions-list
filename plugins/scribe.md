# Scribe for Obsidian 🎙️

Transform your voice into insights with Scribe, an Obsidian plugin that not only records your voice and transcribes it, but summarizes, and enriches the note with the power of AI. 

Dive into a seamless experience where your spoken words are effortlessly converted into a structured, easy-to-navigate knowledge base.  

Forgot a phrase or concept while recording?  Ask "Hey Scribe" followed by a question in the middle of recording and it will fill in the blanks for you

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Voice-to-Text Magic:** Begin recording and watch as your voice notes are transcribed, summarized, and turned into actionable insights.
- **Interactive Queries:** Ask questions mid-recording, and Scribe fetches the answers, integrating them directly into your notes.
- **Mermaid Chart Creation:** Visualize your thoughts and summaries with automatically generated Mermaid charts, providing a unique perspective on your notes.
- **Robust on Failure:** Designed with mobile users in mind, Scribe ensures that no step in the process is a single point of failure. Record, transcribe, and summarize on the go, with each step saved progressively. (WIP)
- **Seamless Integration:** Utilizes AssemblyAI or OpenAI Whisper for top-tier transcription accuracy and OpenAI for cutting-edge summarization

## 🕹️ Commands
### From the Ribbon button
- Either Click Start Recording or Open the Controls Modal
### From the Command Pallette type "Scribe"
- **Begin Recording with Scribe:** - Opens the controls modal for you to begin recording

## 📖 How to Use

## 📱 Mobile

Also a special thanks to [Mossy1022 of the Smart Memos Plugin](https://github.com/Mossy1022/Smart-Memos) including Mermaid Charts is SO useful, and I got that idea from your plugin.
