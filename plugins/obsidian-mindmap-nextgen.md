## Usage

Open the command palette (cmd/ctrl-p) and begin typing the name of one of the 2 commands.

What's the difference between a pinned and an unpinned mindmap? A pinned mindmap is linked to a single Markdown document. An unpinned mindmap will update based on whichever document is the last one you clicked on.

You can also insert mindmaps inside your document using a Markdown code block tagged with "markmap". For example:

~~~
```markmap
# Mindmap
## Mindmap
```
~~~


## "More options" menu

This is the menu in the top right of each tab.

### Pin/Unpin

Switch the tab to unpinned, or pin it to the active document.

### Copy screenshot

Copy a PNG of the mindmap to the clipboard.
Background and text color are configurable in settings or the document's frontmatter.

### Collapse all

Closes all mindmap nodes, leaving just the root visible

### Toggle toolbar

Show or hide the toolbar in the bottom right of the mindmap


## Other Features

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes will be displayed in the mindmap like so:

```
# Housework
## Main
- [x] Dishes
- [ ] Cleaning the bathroom
- [x] Change the light bulbs
- [ ] something else
## [x] Also works on titles
```

### LaTeX
LaTex expressions will be rendered in your mindmaps. Surround an inline expression with a dollar sign on either side.

`$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$`

Or use two dollar signs for a multiline expression.
```
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
$$
```


## Frontmatter

Some settings can be set in each document's frontmatter. Frontmatter settings take precedence over global settings, when set.

The plugin will use any of [markmap's settings](https://markmap.js.org/docs/json-options) except for `extraJs` and `extraCss`).

**Example:**
```markdown
---
markmap:
  screenshotTextColor: #28F48D
  highlight: true
  titleAsRootNode: true
---
```


## Settings

### Coloring approaches
There are three approaches to coloring the branches of the mindmap for you to choose from, either in plugin settings or each document's frontmatter.

#### Branch coloring
This mode will choose random colors per branch. "Color freeze level" decides at what depth the branches will stop changing colors.

#### Depth coloring
In this mode, branches are colored based on their depth in the mindmap. You can choose the first three levels' colors, plus a default color for levels deeper than three.

#### Single color
In this mode, all branches are the same color.


### Line thickness
Set line thickness for the first three depth levels, and a default thickness for levels beyond that.


### Highlight inline markmaps

Frontmatter setting: `highlight`

Add a background to inline markmaps to make them stand out from the rest of the page.


### Use title as root node

Frontmatter setting: `titleAsRootNode`

Generate mindmaps with the title at the bottom level, so you can avoid repeating the title.


### Screenshot settings

Frontmatter settings: `screenshotTextColor`, `screenshotBgColor`

Decide what colors the screenshot function will use.

Take screenshots via the ["More options" menu](#more-options-menu).


### Markmap settings

There is a section in the plugin settings for adjusting the shape and size of different parts of the mindmap. It might seem confusing at first. You'll have to fiddle around with different combinations of settings to get it the way you like.
