The ribbon icon can be used as an alternative to the `Generate a book from a specified folder` command.

## TODO

- [ ] Add support for file and folder pattern rather than names
- [ ] Add possibility to specify the comment to identify books
- [ ] Add possibility to specify spacers to perfect pagination
