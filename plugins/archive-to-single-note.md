# Archive/trash to single note for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Allows to create single file archive/trash and merge(archive) old notes with it.

Old note filename will be prepended to archive as `# ` (top level header).

After merging old filename is removed.


**Hint**:
1. use archive filename without `.md` to hide it from you obsidian vault
2. as `# ` is used as old filename in archive, it's recommended to avoid using it in your notes
