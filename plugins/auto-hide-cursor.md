## Obsidian Auto Hide Cursor

A nice complementary plugin to [obsidian-focus-mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode). Hides the cursor after scrolling up/down, or after a delay, and shows it again after moving the mouse. 

Similar to the chrome extension [Hide mouse pointer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-mouse-pointer/lbbedlldjinglbnfghakndfbagkolfdf)

You can customize the numbers in the settings tab of the plugin.


### Installation

The plugin was accepted by the plugin store. You can find it in the Community Plugins section inside obsidian.

You can also manually install it by copying over `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` to your vault folder `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-auto-hide-cursor/`.
