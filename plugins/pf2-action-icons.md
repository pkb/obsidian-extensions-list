# Pathfinder 2E Action Icons

Injection of the Pathfinder 2E icons for Action, Double Action, Triple Action, Free Action and Reaction.

# Usage

Place a code block with the type of action that you want (eg. \`pf2:2\` for a Double Action) and it will be replaced by the icon in view and live preview.

| Code    | Action        |
| ------- | ------------- |
| \`pf2:1\` | Action        |
| \`pf2:2\` | Two actions   |
| \`pf2:3\` | Three actions |
| \`pf2:0\` | Free action   |
| \`pf2:r\` | Reaction      |

## Fantasy Statblocks

If the property is configured to be `rendered as Markdown` you can add the code block with the action in the text and it will be replaced with the icon.

# Inspiration

This plugin was stringly inspired in the [Dice Roller Plugin](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller), by Javalent. And by the [PF2 Action Icons](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare/tree/main/Pathfinder/2E/action-icons) documentation of the [Obsidian TTRPG Community](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community).
