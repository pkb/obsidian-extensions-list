# Character Insertion Plugin

A plug-in that inserts a specified character in advance at the cursor position.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TakamiChie/Obsidian_CharacterInsertionPlugin/HEAD/demo.gif)

Insert the character set in advance in the cursor position in the settings.

For example, if the value of the specified "input charactor" is the following value...

```
‚≠ê
üî∂
üëç
```

Each time the command is executed, the following characters are inserted / deleted in the cursor position.

```mermaid

  A[Without letters] --> B["‚≠ê"]
  B --> C["üî∂"]
  C --> D["üëç"]
  D --> E["No text <br> (deleted üëç)"]
```

## When to use it?

The author creates a diary with Obsidian.

In the diary, each line marked each line with emoticons, but I felt it was troublesome to copy the mark and paste it to the necessary parts.

Similarly.If you want to mark the markdown documents with fixed rules, I think this plugin will be useful.
