# AI Bot Plugin 🤖

## Overview 🌟

The **AI Bot Plugin** is a powerful tool designed to enhance your note-editing experience in Obsidian by leveraging the capabilities of AI. This plugin allows you to interact with an AI assistant directly within Obsidian, making it easier to generate, edit, and organize your notes with intelligent suggestions and automated tasks.

## Features 🚀

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Get intelligent suggestions and automated tasks directly within Obsidian.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands the context of your notes, providing more accurate and relevant responses.
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure the base URL, API key, and model to suit your needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive modal interface for easy interaction with the AI.
- **Integration with Obsidian**: Seamlessly integrated with Obsidian's core features, including commands and editor menus.

## Advantages 🌈

- **Efficiency**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks and getting quick suggestions.
- **Accuracy**: The AI provides accurate and context-aware responses, enhancing the quality of your notes.
- **Flexibility**: Customize the plugin to work with different AI models and APIs.
- **User-Centric Design**: Designed with the user in mind, offering a smooth and intuitive experience.

## Supported AI Services 🧠

The AI Bot Plugin supports integration with popular AI services such as:

- **DeepSeek**: Access `deepseek-chat` model on DeepSeek.
- **OpenAI**: Utilize models like `GPT-3`, `GPT-4`, and others from OpenAI.
- **Custom APIs**: Configure the plugin to work with any custom AI service by specifying the base URL and API key.

Since the AI Bot plugin uses the [OpenAI Node API Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) at its core, in theory, the AI Bot plugin supports any service that the OpenAI Node API Library supports.
