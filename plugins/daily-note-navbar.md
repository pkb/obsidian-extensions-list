# Daily Note Navbar 

Adds a bar at the top of daily notes to quickly navigate between them.

## Getting Started

This plugin replaces the view header in daily notes files with a navbar. The normal view header is still displayed for other files, and you can still rename daily note files both in the tab bar and in the file explorer.

### Settings Tab

With the settings tab you can customize how the dates are formatted.

## Inspiration

I saw a navbar at the top of daily notes in RemNote and thought it was neat.
