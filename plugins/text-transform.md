# Text Transform

Convert selected text to lower, upper, or title casing.

## How to use

Select text in an editor and use one of the Text Transform commands from the Command Palette to convert the selected text.
For conversion to title case, there are overrides to ignore user-defined words as well as define characters other than a
space to mark word boundaries.
