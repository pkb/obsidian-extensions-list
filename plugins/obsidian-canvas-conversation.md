# Obsidian Canvas Conversation

A plugin for Obsidian that allows you to create a canvas conversation using ChatGPT.

It works on Canvas Nodes. Right-click a node and "Prompt ChatGPT".

This needs to be configured with User Agent, Session Token, and Clearance token from ChatGPT, which you might need to refresh every 2 hours.

The code is mostly undocumented and messy.

Some improvements to be made:

-   Proper using a streaming mechanism for the chat conversation
-   Refreshing tokens
-   Clean up undocumented APIs/monkey patches when they are available
-   Better error messages
-   Add edges between nodes (no easy way of doing it right now)
