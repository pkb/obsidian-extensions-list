# Todoist Link

Seamlessly create *Todoist* tasks and projects from Obsidian.

## Setup 

Go to the settings and add your Todoist API Key. You get your todoist API key [here](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations).
## Commands

`Create Todoist Project` will create a new Todoist project from the current note and add deeplinks between the two for easy navitagion. The name of the todoist project is the name of the file you execute the command in. The plugin adds at the cursor position a link to the todoist project with the title *Todoist*.

`Create Todoist Task` will create a new Todoist task in the Inbox from the current line in the Obsidian note and add deeplinks between the two for easy navigation.

## Thanks & Attribution
