# Obsidian YouVersion Linker Plugin

**Automatically link bible verses in your notes to YouVersion bible.**

**List of supported languages can be found [here](./Languages.md).**

You need to just type for example: `@ John 1:1-6` to link verse to quote verse use for example: `> John 1:1-6`. Now it also supports multiple verses like: `John 3:16,18-20`.

`@` and `>` char is a trigger for suggestion and it can be changed in settings.
In settings you can select witch version of bible you want to use and books names in witch language will be detected.

I'm from Poland so plugin supports polish books names (eq. `J 1:1-6`, `Mt 24,1`). If you would like it to support your language books names read the guide in [Languages.md](./Languages.md).

The plugins is heavily inspired by [obsidian-bible-reference](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference) (also i have "borrowed" some code from there) so check it out.

It's available in Obsidian community plugins as
[YouVersion Linker](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=youversion-linker).
