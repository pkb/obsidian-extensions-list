# obsidian-open-in-other-editor

Open the current active file in gVim, VScode, or nvim-qt.

## How To Use

1. Ensure that you can use the `code`, `gvim`, or `nvim-qt` commands in the terminal.
2. `Ctrl` + `p` to open the command palette, then search for `open in other`

### For macOS Users

1. Put the absolute path to editor terminal command (`code` | `gvim`†) in `Open in other editor` settings tab.
† Gvim functionality may be a work in progress. Functionality on non-darwin(mac) machines may also be a work in progress.
