# Obsidian Vim Yank Highlight Plugin

Highlight yanked text in Obsidian Vim mode with a subtle animation you've missed so much.

## Why?

The Vim mode in CodeMirror [lacks native support for highlighting yanked text](https://github.com/replit/codemirror-vim/issues/121) and it's unlikely to be implemented.

There is already a [yank highlighter plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/obsidian-vim-yank-highlight), but it relies on monkey-patching the `codemirror-vim` code which I wanted to avoid.

## Features

-   Make the yanked region apparent!
