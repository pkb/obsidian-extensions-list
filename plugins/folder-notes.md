# Obsidian folder notes

Folder notes is a plugin for the note taking app  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you attach notes to folders so that you can click on the name of a folder to open the note like in the app [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
This plugin has some unique features that separate it from similar "Folder note" plugins like opening folder notes through the path, creating folder notes for every existing folder, templater/template support and more.

## Documentation & download link
The plugin can be downloaded by clicking on https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=folder-notes and then on install. If you need help with the plugin or want to know what the features are that the plugin has then you can find the documentation at https://lostpaul.github.io/obsidian-folder-notes/.
