# Obsidian TodoTxt Plugin

Manage [\*.todotxt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) files in Obsidian.

![Sample TodoTxt file in Obsidian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvgrimes/obsidian-todotxt-plugin/HEAD/docs/screenshot.png)

Install the plugin and put your todo file in your Obsidian vault with the
`.todotxt` extension (ie, `TODO.todotxt`).

Creating a `.todotxt` file from within Obsidian can be a bit tricky. When you
create a new note Obsidian will automatically append the `.md` extension, so
`TODO.todotxt` becomes `TODO.todotxt.md`. To fix this, you can right-click on
the file in Obsidian sidebar, select Reveal in Finder/File Explorer, and then
change the file extension to `.todotxt`. If you are successful, the file will
be listed in the Obsidian sidebar followed by a `TODOTXT` badge.

## Additional Features

The TodoTxt Plugin supports some extensions to the basic todo.txt spec:

### Due Dates

Due dates can be specified by including `due:yyyy-mm-dd` in the text of the
task item. The plugin will highlight the due date and shift to orange as the
date nears then red when the due date is missed. The date must be specified in
the `yyyy-mm-dd` format (including padding the month or day with a `0` if
needed) and no whitespace may be included.

### Preserving Priorities on Complete

EXPERIMENATL: This feature is experimental and needs to be enabled in the settings.

As described in the todo.txt [spec](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt),
priorities are typically discarded when a task is marked as complete. This
extension to the spec will preserve the priority in a `pri:X` tag. It will also
restore the priority if the task is later marked as uncompleted.

### Recurring Tasks

EXPERIMENATL: This feature is experimental and needs to be enabled in the settings.
This is not part of the todo.txt [spec](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

Recurring tasks can be specified by including the `rec:` tag. When such a task
is marked as complete a new task will created with a `due:` tag based on the
value in the `rec:` tag.

See further documentation of [recurring tasks](docs/RECURRING.md).

### Threshhold Dates

Threshold dates are indicated by the `t:YYYY-MM-DD` tag. Tasks with a specified
threshold are not considered ready to be undertaken until the threshold date.
The Todotxt Plugin will display tasks with threshold dates in the future with a
subtlely muted text.

## How to Install by Hand

1. Clone this repo.
1. `pnpm install` to install dependencies
1. `pnpm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually Installing the Plugin

Copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault
`VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/todotxt-plugin/`.

    cp dist/* VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/todotxt-plugin/

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Use `tab` and `shift-tab` to navigate through your todos.

- `ctrl-n` to create a New todo task
- `ctrl-/` goto filter input
- `e` or `enter` to Edit the current todo task
- `d` to Delete the current todo task
- `space` toggle done

## Future Development

- [x] Delete a Todo
- [x] Edit a Todo
- [x] Keyboard shortcut to create new Todo
- [x] Keyboard navigation through TODOs
- [x] Priority colors are a bit bright
- [ ] Better handling for Todo.parse() errors
- [ ] Global keyboard shortcut to create new Todo
- [ ] Command palette command to create new Todo
- [ ] Config menu set the default .todotxt file
- [ ] Command palette to create a new .todotxt file

## Development

Helpful commands to run while developing:

```shell
pnpm run dev # compile typescript to ./dist via esbuild
pnpm run css # compile css to ./dist via postcss
pnpm run cp # copy files from ./dist to Obsidian plugins dir
pnpm run parser:watch # compile .peggy grammar to parser.js
pnpm run test:watch # run tests in watch mode
```

We are using the moment package because Obsidian already requires it. Otherwise
would use something lighter weight (like date-fns) or built-in.

* Thanks to the authors of [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com/) for documenting
  the due and recurring extensions to the spec.

## Support

I've been asked if there are ways to support this plugin. I created it to
scratch my own itch and am just happy that others find it useful. Giving it a
star on github would be appreciated. If you are feeling extra generous, you can
buy me a coffee â˜•.
