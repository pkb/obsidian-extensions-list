# Battery Indicator Plugin for Obsidian
This plugin displays a battery indicator in Obsidian's status bar.

A few visual aspects can be adjusted in the settings, like showing a textual percentage value and separating the battery level and charging indicator into separate icons.

The battery level thresholds for different icons will be customizable in a future update.

This plugin pairs great with the [statusbar organizer](https://github.com/Opisek/obsidian-statusbar-organizer) plugin, in case you only want to show the battery indicator while in full-screen or if you want to change the indicator's position in the status bar.
