# Desk for Obsidian

**Desk** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that lets you
choose some of your notes and see them together, at a glance.
The notes are laid down in a 4x6 aspect ratio which is 
typically used in analog Zettelkasten systems. 
The inspiration for this plugin is to emulate picking up the cards for a particular topic, and laying them down on a desk.
To learn more about the rationale behind the plugin, read [this post](https://blog.dlandry.xyz/posts/obsidian_desk/).
