# Obsidian Recent Tab Switcher Plugin

## Motivations
As a heavy user of [Tab Manager Plus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-manager-plus-for-chro/cnkdjjdmfiffagllbiiilooaoofcoeff) on Google Chrome, I'm extremely used to using a shortcut/hotkey that switches to the previously active tab.

Unfortunately, existing tab switchers on Obsidian don't seem to have this functionality. [This](https://github.com/Vinzent03/tab-switcher) one seems to do a really good job cycling through panes though!

## Usage
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelrawrs/recent-tab-switcher/HEAD/media/recent-tab-switcher-plugin.gif)
The default hotkey is "Alt+Q" to switch toggle between the active tab and the last active tab.
Feel free to customize the hotkey in Options -> Hotkeys.


## Future Features
(if I should have the time)
- Cycle through more tabs based on history of last used
- Adding visual cues to show which is the tab that will be switched to
