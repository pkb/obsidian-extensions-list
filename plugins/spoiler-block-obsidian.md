| <kbd>Double-click</kbd>                           | Hide information            |


## How to Install

### From within Obsidian

From Obsidian v0.15.0+, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

- Search for "Spoiler Block"
- Click Install
- Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin

## Notes

This version only includes the basic functionality. If anyone is interested in improving the 
block by making it render markdown instead of just text, feel free to contribute. Another 
potential feature that could be added is a command to reveal all the spoilers on the current page.
