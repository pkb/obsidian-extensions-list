# Obsidian Lock Screen Plugin

Adds lock screen functionality to Obsidian. _This is a UI-only feature; no actual filesystem encryption is taking place._

## Features

### Desktop

-   Show lock screen when window loses focus (with configurable delay)

### Mobile

-   Show lock screen when interaction stops (with configurable delay). This is a workaround for sensing when the app has been backgrounded until Obsidian's API can notify plugins about app backgrounding.

### Both

-   Show lock screen when vault is initially opened
-   Show lock screen via command palette
