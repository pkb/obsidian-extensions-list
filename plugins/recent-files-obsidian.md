# Recent Files for Obsidian

This plugin displays a list of most recently opened files in the sidebar.
Optionally include paths of files which should be excluded from the list.

That's all there is to it!

As with the file explorer view, you can:

* Click items to open, ctrl-click to open in a new pane, right-click for a menu
* Drag items to an editor to drop a link, to a header to open in a specific pane, or to a file explorer folder to move the file
* Hover or ctrl-hover to view a content preview (as configured by the "Recent Files" toggle in the "Page Preview" settings)

## Other Plugin Support

If you use the [Front Matter Title plugin](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title), enable the explorer module to name files in the Recent Files sidebar from the note frontmatter title.
