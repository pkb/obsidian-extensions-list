**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: The existing customised database should be recreated if you want to update to version 2.3.0. The new version has a new database structure, and the old database structure is not compatible with the new version to build the index properly.**

## How to use

If you want to use this plugin, you need to follow the following steps to set up the plugin. The steps can be divided into two parts: setting up the Notion API and setting up the plugin in Obsidian.

### 1. Setting up the Notion API

1). Go to [Notion API](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations) to create a new integration, and **copy the token**.

![create-api](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/28526e416571f8b1fe70d90bd9975b81.gif)

2). Create a database in your Notion workspace.

Open Notion, click top-left `Create` a new page` -> You can give a title for the page and press "/" Select 'Database - Full page'.

![create-database](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/f1bd993ed667bcc980a45194eb647c34.gif)

Rename the database properties to `title` and `tags`.
**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è`title` is the title column! `tags` is lower case‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

![rename-title-tags](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/20c7b81761195706dde6e7dae69edbc4.gif)

3). Add the Notion API integration.

Click the right-top '...' -> connections -> connect to -> find the integration you created and connect it.

![add-integration](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/bf59397146d96727c96dac06515c6c22.gif)

4). Publish the database to the public.
Click the 'Share' -> 'Publish' -> 'Publish' -> **copy the database id from the URL**.

![share-publish](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/5e5b9585cfa4a9086ef6704c3b48eacf.gif)

### 2. Setting up the plugin in Obsidian

1). Go to Obsidian settings -> community plugins -> search 'NotionNext' -> install it.
  ![plugin](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/1bf82618e943ec5eb68d89d4556bc3fc.png)

2). Open the plugin settings and create a new database.

![add-database](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/115f47b4180d04fb362b931f8092b5fb.png)

### 3. Create a database

**You can create three types of databases:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ General database

General database is the default database, which only has the `title` and `tags` columns. **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è`title` and `tags` are lowercase‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

![general](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/b2d0d0259afae7a542bd9f62256cd2c2.png)

The general is as follows:

- Full Name: the full name that you would like to give to the database.
- Abbreviate Name: the abbreviation that you would like to give to the database.
- Notion tags sync: whether you want to sync the tags column to Notion.
- Customise title property: whether you want to change the `title` to another name (e.g., `name`).
- Notion API token: the token you copied from the Notion API page.
- Notion Database ID: the database ID you copied from the Notion database URL. (e.g., only copy `7158cd3f70ce4f60afd9da5bdf74fd0c` between `site/` and `?`. `https://jxpeng.notion.site/7158cd3f70ce4f60afd9da5bdf74fd0c?v=380317ac5373sadasdas3c13e618f&pvs=4**`)

After setting, it should look like this:

![general-setting](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/3fc630171f6e8ae1011271b2b37d5d48.png)

Once you click `save`, the new database will be created in the plugin settings and display in the detabase list.

![database-list](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/3dff23b1c13a31f7696dc794fb78eba5.png)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ NotionNext database

If you use [NotionNext](https://github.com/tangly1024/NotionNext) to set up your website, you can use the NotionNext database. (**All the properties are in lowercase, and you do not need to change the properties**)

![notionnext](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/b164160ccfaf4fb23aa7ac1ce467e235.png)

Like the general database, you need to fill in the following information:

- Full Name: the full name that you would like to give to the database.
- Abbreviate Name: the abbreviation that you would like to give to the database.
- Notion API token: the token you copied from the Notion API page.
- Notion Database ID: the database ID you copied from the Notion database URL.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Custom database

The custom database is purely customised, and you can customise the properties you want to sync. (**All the properties are in lowercase, and you do not need to change the properties**)

![customise](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/612b1377ec94d452abec7dc3fbe6cefb.png)

The basic information is identical to the general database and NotionNext database. You need to fill in the following information:

- Full Name: the full name that you would like to give to the database.
- Abbreviate Name: the abbreviation that you would like to give to the database.
- Notion API token: the token you copied from the Notion API page.
- Notion Database ID: the database ID you copied from the Notion database URL.

After adding the information, You can click `Add New Property` to add the properties you want to sync. There is no limit to the number of properties you can add.

![customise-add-property](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/17cfbfa93d92404ff70d920302f15981.png)

**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**: **`Title column` is the main property in the Notion database, which has the open button to open the underlying page.** You can select the type of all other properties. **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

![title-column](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/0521b0aa6cedbe67bca4966bf79041ea.png)

According to the previously shown database, you can use `title` as the `Title column`, and `Tags` as the property 1.

![title-and-tags](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/87529214008147d3aa1bbe5868849f31.png)

**Until now, you have set up the plugin in Obsidian. You can start syncing your notes to Notion.**

### 4. Start syncing

Create a new note in Obsidian, and fill in the front matter with the properties you want to sync.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ note for general database

For example, we can create a test note with the following front matter:

``` markdown
---
title: test
tags: [test, web]
---

This is a test file. 

```

After creating the note, you can click the `Share to NotionNext` button on the left sidebar to sync the note to Notion.

![general-sync](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/6a690dc4b04d6b74134e9d3d76636c1b.gif)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ note for NotionNext database

We use the following front matter for the NotionNext database:

```markdown
---
title: test-notionnext
titleicon: üìé
date: 2023-07-23
coverurl: https://img.jxpeng.dev/2023/08/843e27a210847f05a0f7cfb121fec100.jpg
type: Post
slug: test
status: Draft
category: test
summary: this is a summary for test post
icon: fa-solid fa-camera
password: "1234"
tags:
  - test
  - web
NotionID-pengjiaxin: 8ba573de-8fdf-4681-b063-c39d26e7860e
---

this is a test file
```

![notionnext-sync](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/5539ec534e7a855ad87aa7949e5e836f.gif)

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ note for custom database

##### sync title and tags

Use the previously created general database and rename `title` to `Name` and `tags` to `Tags` in Notion.

![rename-notion](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/e4d1c988be22353537998db897c7a471.gif)

The front matter for the custom database is as follows:

```markdown
---
Name: test-custom
Tags:
  - test
  - web
---

This is a test file. 
```

![sync-custom](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/973f17955cd921cca6b5007f0990eea4.gif)

##### sync more properties

Add more property to the custom database. For example, we can add a `summary` and `date` property to the custom database.

  1). Click `Edit` in the plugin settings.
  ![edit](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/f50639d8118b1f106d7bb29be5d3527b.png)
  2). Click `Add` and add the `summary` and `date` property.

![add-property](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/49716657adf0255a37fa214abf4716dc.gif)

  3). After adding the properties, you can see the properties in the plugin settings.
  ![four properties](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/63a0a0e09d537b1cf55cfdc49de4db1a.png)
  4). Add the `summary` and `date` in Notion

  ![add-in-notion](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/d193fe72ce3676bf643b0d1eb92dd4b7.gif)

  5). Create a new note with the `summary` and `date` property.
    
  ```markdown
  ---
  Name: test-custom-more
  Tags:
    - test
    - web
  summary: this is a summary for test custom
  date: 2022-05-03
  ---

  This is a test file.
  ```

  6). Sync the note to Notion.

  ![sync-custom](https://minioapi.pjx.ac.cn/img1/2024/07/0e4cfbd61acdaf813fd81ee6d046e067.gif)

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to the [original author](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion) for developing such a useful plugin that can synchronize Obsidian to Notion. However, the original repository can only sync Name and Tag information. For those like me who use [NotionNext](https://github.com/tangly1024/NotionNext) to set up their website, this presents some limitations. Every time I import, I need to make a lot of modifications.

Thus, based on the [original author's work](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion), I've added a feature to match the [NotionNext](https://github.com/tangly1024/NotionNext) template. This way, you can edit directly in Obsidian and publish with a single click after organizing.

---

<details> <summary> Original README.md </summary>

Many Thanks for the original author's work. I've only made some changes to the original author's work. If you find this plugin useful, please give the [original author](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion) a star.
