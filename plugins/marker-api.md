## üåü Introduction

Welcome to this Obsidian PDF to Markdown Converter! This plugin brings the power of advanced PDF conversion directly into your Obsidian vault. By leveraging the capabilities of Marker through a self-hosted API or by using the hosted solution on [datalab.to](https://www.datalab.to/), this plugin offers a seamless way to transform your PDFs into rich, formatted Markdown files, with support for tables, formulas and more!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires a Marker API endpoint to function. Without an endpoint, the application won't work.

You can find the related repositories here:

- [Marker Project](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) (AI model for PDF conversion)
- [Marker API](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/marker-api) (API for self-hosting the conversion service)
- [Marker API Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/wirawan/marker-api) (Container for self-hosting, needs Nvidia GPU)
- [datalab.to](https://www.datalab.to/) (Hosted API for the Marker AI model, provided by the developer himself)

## üöÄ Features

- **OCR Capabilities**: Convert scanned PDFs to rich markdown
- **Formula Detection**: Accurately captures and converts mathematical formulas
- **Table Extraction**: Preserves table structures in your Markdown output
- **Image Handling**: Extracts and saves images from your PDFs and includes them in the markdown
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Works on both desktop and mobile Obsidian apps
- **Flexible Output**: Choose between full content extraction or specific elements (text/images)

## üõ† Why This Plugin?

1. **Superior Extraction**: Utilizes the Marker project's advanced AI model for high-quality conversions
2. **Mobile Accessibility**: Unlike many converters, this works seamlessly on mobile devices (when the API is accessible)
3. **Customizable**: Tailor the conversion process to your specific needs
4. **Obsidian Integration**: Converts PDFs directly within your Obsidian environment

## üìã Requirements

To use this plugin, you'll need:

1. A working Obsidian installation
2. Access to a Marker API endpoint (self-hosted or paid service)

## üîß Setup

1. Install the plugin in your Obsidian vault
2. (Optional) Set up the self-hosted Marker API:

   - Use Docker on a machine with a solid GPU/CPU
   - (Optional) Make the endpoint available to other devices (e.g., using Tailscale)
   - Alternatively, host in the cloud or run the Python server as needed
3. Configure your Marker API endpoint in the plugin settings
