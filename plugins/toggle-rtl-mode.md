# Toggle RTL mode

A simple plugin to toggle RTL (right-to-left) mode.

Toggling RTL mode using this plugin is equivalent to toggling RTL from `Settings --> Editor --> Right-to-left (RTL)`.

In particular, the toggle will be applied globally to all files in the vault, and there is no need to toggle each file separately.


## How to use

After the plugin is installed, a new [arrow-right-left](https://lucide.dev/icons/arrow-right-left) icon will appear in the ribbon sidebar.

You can toggle RTL mode by either clicking the ribbon icon, or by executing a command action from the Command Palette:

1. Type `Ctrl + P` (or `Command + P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette
2. Type `rtl` and find the `Toggle RTL mode: Toggle` command
3. press `Enter` to toggle


## Using a keybord shortcut

It is recommended to assign a hotkey to the plugin, and then toggle RTL mode using a keybord shortcut.

Go to `Community plugins --> Toggle RTL mode --> Hotkeys` and assign your favorite key combination.
