# Obsidian Note Definitions

A personal dictionary that can be easily looked-up from within your notes.

![dropdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominiclet/obsidian-note-definitions/HEAD/img/def-dropdown.png)

## Basic usage

1. Create a folder, right-click on the folder in your file explorer, and select `Set definition folder`. This registers the folder as your definition folder.
2. Within the folder, create definition files (with any name of your choice).
3. Add a definition using the `Add definition` command. This will display a pop-up modal, where you can input your definition.
4. Once a definition is added, the word/phrase should be underlined in your notes. You may preview the definition of the word by hovering over the underlined word/phrase with the mouse, or triggering the `Preview definition` command when your cursor is on the word/phrase.

### Editor menu

Options available:
- Go to definition (jump to definition of word/phrase)
- Add definition (the text that you want to define must be highlighted for this to be available)
- Edit definition (right-click on an underlined definition)

### Commands

You may want to assign hotkeys to the commands available for easy access:
- Preview definition (show definition popover)
- Go to definition (jump to definition of word/phrase)
- Add definition
- Add definition context (see [Definition context](#definition-context))
- Register consolidated definition file
- Register atomic definition file
- Refresh definitions

## How it works

**Note Definitions** does not maintain any hidden metadata files for your definitions. 
All definitions are placed in your vault and form part of your notes.
You will notice that added definitions will create entries within your selected definition file. 
You may edit these entries freely to add/edit your definitions, but if you do so, make sure to adhere strictly to the definition rules below.
**It is recommended that you read through the definition rules first before manually editing the definition files.**

### Definition rules

Currently, there are two types of definition files: `consolidated` and `atomic`.
The type of definition file is specified in the `def-type` frontmatter (or property) of a file.
For all definition files you create, the `def-type` frontmatter should be set to either 'consolidated' or 'atomic'.
For compatibility reasons, a file is treated to be `consolidated` if the `def-type` frontmatter is not specified (but this is not guaranteed to remain the same in subsequent releases, so always specify the frontmatter when creating a new definition file). 
For convenience, use the commands provided to add the `def-type` frontmatter.

#### Consolidated definition file

A `consolidated` file type refers to a file that can contain many definitions.
Register a definition file by specifying the `def-type: consolidated` frontmatter, or using the `Register consolidated definition file` command when the file is active.

A `consolidated` definition file is parsed according to the following rules:

1. A definition block consists of a **phrase (1 or more words), an alias (optional) and a definition**. They must be provided **strictly** in that order.
2. A phrase is denoted with a line in the following format `# <PHRASE>`. This is rendered as a markdown header in Obsidian.
3. An **optional** comma-separated line of alias(es) is expected after a phrase. This must be a line surrounded by asterisks, eg. `*alias*`. *This is rendered as italics in Obsidian*.
4. A line that occurs after a registered **phrase** and is not an alias is deemed to be a definition. Definitions can be multi-line. All subsequent lines are definitions until the definition block divider is encountered. You may write markdown here, which will be formatted similar to Obsidian's markdown formatting.
5. A line with nothing but three hyphens `---` is used as a divider to separate definition blocks. This is rendered as a delimiting line in Obsidian. (This divider can be configured in the settings to recognise three underscores `___` as well)

Example definition file:

> # Word1
> 
> *alias of word1*
> 
> Definition of word1.
> This definition can span several lines.
> It will end when the divider is reached.
> 
> ---
> 
> # Word2
>
> Notice that there is no alias here as it is optional.
> The last word in the file does not need to have a divider, although it is still valid to have one.
> 
> ---
> 
> # Phrase with multiple words
> 
> You can also define a phrase containing multiple words. 
>
> ---
>
> # Markdown support
> 
> Markdown is supported so you can do things like including *italics* or **bold** words.

#### Atomic definition file

An `atomic` definition file refers to a file that contains only one definition.
Register an atomic definition file by specifying the `def-type: atomic` frontmatter, or using the `Register atomic definition file` command when the file is active.

An `atomic` definition file is parsed according to the following rules:
1. The name of the file is the word/phrase defined
2. Aliases are specified in the `aliases` frontmatter as a list. In source, it should look something like this:
```
---
aliases:
  - alias1
  - alias2
---
```
3. The contents of the file (excluding the frontmatter) form the definition

## Definition context
> _TLDR:_ "Context" is synonymous with a definition file. By specifying a context, you specify that you want to use specific definition file(s) to source your definitions for the current note.

Definition context refers to the repository of definitions that are available for the currently active note.
By default, all notes have no context (you can think of this as being globally-scoped).
This means that your newly-created notes will always have access to the combination of all definitions defined in your definition files.

This behaviour can be overridden by specifying the "context" of your note.
Each definition file that you have is taken to be a separate context (hence your definitions should be structured accordingly).
Once context(s) are declared for a note, it will only retrieve definitions from the specified contexts.
You can think of this as having a local scope for the note.
The note now sees only a limited subset of all your definitions.

### Usage

To easily add context to your note:
1. Use the `Add definition context` command
2. Search and select your desired context

You can do this multiple times to add multiple contexts.

### How it works

`Add definition context` adds to the _properties_ of your note.
Specifically, it adds to the `def-context` property, which is a `List` type containing a list of file paths corresponding to the selected definition files.
In source, it will look something like this:
```
---
def-context:
	- definitions/def1.md
	- definitions/def2.md
---
```

You can edit your properties directly, although for convenience, it is recommended to use the `Add definition context` command to add contexts as it is easy to get file paths wrong.

### Removing contexts

To remove contexts, simply remove the file path from the `def-context` property.
Or if you want to remove all contexts, you can delete the `def-context` property altogether.

## Refreshing definitions

Whenever you find that the plugin is not detecting certain definitions or definition files, run the `Refresh definitions` command to manually get the plugin to read your definition files.
