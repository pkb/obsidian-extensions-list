# MOC Link Helper

> Requires **Dataview** plugin to work.

> Desktop only. Cannot use on mobile.

---

This is a plugin to help linking your **child notes** to your **MOC** notes.
This task is usually achieved by two-way link:
- The **MOC** note includes **children notes** in its content.
- A **child note** has an **up** property saying that it comes from a specific **MOC**.

## What this plugin does

Adds the command `MOC Link Helper: Open View` that will open the view to help you link notes and also find possible "lost notes" of your MOC.
> The Open View command is also added as a *ribbon button*.

## How to use

### View - Notes Included

The **Notes Included** view is where you will see all the notes in the selected MOC and be able to do the following operations:
- Add a link to this MOC to all of the notes **up** frontmatter property.
  - You will be warned with the notes that do not have an up-link to the current MOC not, but are included in your MOC.
- Remove the link to this MOC from all included notes.
  - This can be useful for when you want to remove an MOC.

This view also contains 3 filtering options of the notes
- **All** - shows you all included notes
  - Linking operations do not affect MOC notes on this filter.
- **Notes** - shows you all included notes, except MOC notes
- **MOC** - shows only included MOC notes
  - Operations will work on all MOCs. (If you want all the sub-MOCs to have an up-link to this note)

- You can also *select text in the MOC* and it will filter the notes on the view to the selected ones only.
  - This can be useful for when you want to split your MOC from including all notes to mutliple smaller MOCs. So if I want to turn **Red Fruits** into an MOC, I firstly remove the link to the **Fruits MOC** from all the red ones.

> When selection is activated, the linking operations will be applied only to the selected files.
> - Will link even MOCs if they are selected

### View - Missing Notes

This view will show any notes that have an **up-link** to this MOC, but are not included in the MOC.

- You can easily insert them as links at the position of your text cursor.

### Child notes

There are also small functionalities on child notes. You can see the note's parents (which are included in its up links) and also a possible MOCs that it belongs to.
