# IOC Lens

[**IOC Lens**](https://gabbert.me/Projects/IOC+Lens) is a note-taking helper for Obsidian focused on cyber security and incident response.

As security professionals, we encounter indicators of compromise (IOCs) constantly in our work. Whether youâ€™re an incident responder, threat researcher, or SOC analyst, keeping track of these indicators within lengthy notes can be challenging. IOC Lens solves this by providing a dedicated Obsidian view that automatically extracts and organizes:
- IP addresses (both public and private)
- Domain names
- SHA256 hashes
- MD5 hashes

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acgabbert/ioc-lens/refs/heads/main/resources/usage-example.png)

To activate IOC Lens, click the ribbon icon or use the command palette.

Key features:
- Automatic IOC extraction from your notes
- Smart recognition of both standard and defanged IOCs (e.g. "evil[.]com")
- One-click pivot buttons to search indicators across various security engines
- Clean, organized view of all IOCs in your current note

Security considerations:
- It's recommended to defang IOCs in your notes (e.g., using "evil[.]com" instead of "evil.com") to prevent accidental clicks or automated scanning
- For compatibility with search engines, IOCs are automatically "refanged" in the sidebar view and when using the search pivot buttons
- IOCs are displayed as plaintext in the sidebar - they are never clickable links
- All interaction with IOCs is intentional and requires explicit user action

IOC Lens currently supports pivots to the following resources/search engines. Pivots are configurable via toggle switches in the plugin settings.
