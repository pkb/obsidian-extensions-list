https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15689774/203650814-d8bd8164-c4c5-46cd-8cfe-8207f24ff9aa.mp4

## Features
- Adds a command to scroll the content of opened file (activate autoscroll)
- Adds commands to increase/decrease autoscroll speed
- Adds a button to activate/disactivate autoscroll
- Right click on the button to change the scroll speed
- Adds a setting to remove the button in case you want to put it elsewhere
    (e.g. with the [Commander plugin](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander/)) or hotkeys

# Known issues
- Doesn't work if you push the button before clicking on a file content (the plugin scrolls through opened and focused file)
