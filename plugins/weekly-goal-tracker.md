## Weekly Goal Tracker Plugin for Obsidian
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to add buttons to the status bar that allow you to track of different weekly/daily goals and update them with ease. 

For example you could track a weekly exercise goal or a daily reading goal.

## Buttons
When the button is closed, it displays an icon, the current value and the goal value

When the goal has been reached, the button displays in color

### Controls

1. Using **left click**, the button can opened to show a progress bar in color

2. While the button is open, press **right click** to +1 to the goal.

3. While the button is open, hold **shift** and press **right click** to -1 from the goal

## Tasks
Tasks can be attached to goals so that they increase its progress when completed

In editor mode, use the 'Attach task to goal' command to bring up a menu allowing you to choose a goal and how many points the task is worth (optional)

## General Settings
- Hide numbers when button is closed? : Allows you to display the buttons with the icon only when it is closed
- Allow tasks to be worth multiple points? : You will be given a prompt when attaching a task to a goal to input how many points it is worth
- Monday note or weekly note for weekly goals? : Decides whether to use the monday note or the weekly note (typically in the format eg.2024-W48) to store the data for weekly goals. Daily goals are always stored in the current daily note
## Activity Settings
- Daily or weekly goal? : should this goal reset daily or weekly
- Frontmatter value : the value in the frontmatter to read and write to
- Icon : the icon displayed in the status bar button. I recommend using [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) to find icons
- Goal : the weekly goal for activity
- Start color/end color : the gradient color for the status bar button, from left to right
- ÊŒ/v : change the order in which buttons appear in the status bar
