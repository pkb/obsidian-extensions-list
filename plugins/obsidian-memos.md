## Basic Introduction

1. All Thinos are sourced from your notes. If you are using the basic version, then all Thinos originate from your diary files. For more information, please visit [link](https://thino.pkmer.net/en/thino/01_thino-basic/01_thino-basic-tutorial/).
2. In diary mode, it accesses content under a specified title or the entire text of the diary, parsing it into Thinos. A common format is `- 12:00 abcd`.
3. Each Thino you input will be inserted at the end of your specified title or at the end of the full text.

You can read thinos from multi-source, please visit [link](https://thino.pkmer.net/en/).

## Additional Features

Please refer to our official documentation website: [link](https://thino.pkmer.net/en/thino).

## How to Use

1. You need to activate the Daily Notes core plugin at a minimum (If you are a thino pro user, you can disable daily notes plugin when you disable the diary mode).
2. Before using, please configure at least two settings: processing under the specified title in diary mode and inserting under the specified title.
3. Open Thino, enter content, and click the `noteit` button.
4. The content you input will be automatically inserted into your diary file.

## Basic Example (Daily Note Mode)

The content you input will be transformed into the following format:

```markdown  
- 22:15 {your input content}  
```  

The following markdown text formats will be properly parsed in daily note mode:

```markdown  
- 19:00 abcd  
- [ ] 19:00 cdef  
```
