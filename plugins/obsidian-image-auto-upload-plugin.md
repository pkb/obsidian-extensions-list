# Obsidian Image Auto Upload Plugin

This is a tool that supports uploading images to image beds using PicGo, PicList, and PicGo-Core.
**Remember to restart Obsidian after updating the plugin.**

**Not tested on Mac**

# Start

1. Install the PicGo tool and configure it, refer to the [official website](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo)
2. Enable PicGo's Server service and remember the port number
3. Install the plugin
4. Open the plugin settings and set it to `http://127.0.0.1:{{port set in PicGo}}/upload` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:36677/upload`)
5. Try to see if the upload is successful

## Set picbed and configName

If you are using PicList (version >= 2.5.3), you can set the picbed and configName through URL parameters.
Example: `http://127.0.0.1:36677/upload?picbed=smms&configName=piclist`
This will upload the image to the `smms` picbed and use the piclist configName.
Using this feature, you can upload images to different picbeds in different Obsidian vaults.

# Features

## Upload when paste image

When you paste an image to Obsidian, this plugin will automatically upload your image.

You can set `image-auto-upload: false` in `frontmatter` to control one file.

Supports ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".bmp", ".gif", ".svg", ".tiff", ".webp", ".avif"

Due to the [bug](https://github.com/renmu123/obsidian-image-auto-upload-plugin/issues/2) in PicGo 2.3.0-beta7, you cannot use this feature. Please install another version of PicGo.
