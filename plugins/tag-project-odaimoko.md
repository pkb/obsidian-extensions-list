# Quick start

## Installation

1. In Obsidian, open Settings > Community plugins > Browse.
1. Search for "Tag Project" by Odaimoko.
1. Select `Install`.

> You need to also install another Obsidian plugin, [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), in
> order to use Tag Project.
>
> Although it's a brilliant plugin, I am planning to remove this dependency in the future.

## Usage

Define a workflow

```
- [ ] my_workflow #tpm/workflow_type/chain 
```

Assign a task to this workflow

```
- [ ] A task with my workflow. #tpm/workflow/my_workflow 
```

Open the Manage Page, and you will see the tasks.

- Command Palatte > Open Manage Page

## Set Hotkeys

Open Obsidian Settings > Hotkeys > Tag Project

I use `Meta+Shift+W`, `W` stands for workflow.

# Inspiration / Design Philosophy

No Obsidian plugin solves the combination of the following problems

- Tasks are spread across the vault
- But I want to manage them in a single page
- Each task belongs to certain pre-defined workflow
- There are plenty of tasks with the same workflow
- Workflows and tasks should be easily defined and assigned

Fine, I'll do it myself.

Here's a screenshot of the tasks I created with *Tag Project* when developing it.
