## 1 Introduction

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exmemo-ai/obsidian-exmemo-client/HEAD/images/img1.png)

ExMemo is a personal knowledge management project designed to centrally record and manage various types of information, including favorite texts, books, music, videos, web pages, work documents, as well as reflections and thoughts about life. By systematically integrating these elements, it aims to break through cognitive limitations and discover internal connections.

The system consists of a database, backend, and multiple front-ends. Distributed storage and databases are used to store user files, text, and corresponding vector data. Data storage can be deployed locally to protect user privacy. The backend provides general interfaces for data creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) operations and is responsible for invoking large models and processing data. The system supports mainstream online large models like OpenAI, Gemini, Qwen as well as offline models like Ollama. Multiple front-ends are available in the form of web services, WeChat bots, Obsidian plugins, and browser extensions for users to upload and download data.
