## Notice

DataLoom is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/issues/958).

Please [export](https://dataloom.xyz/basics/export) any existing DataLoom files into raw markdown format. This will make your data available with the native Obsidian table editor.

If you run into any problems with exporting, please open a [bug report](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug). I will promptly respond and fix the issue.

As alternatives to DataLoom, I recommend the following plugins:

-   [Vault Explorer](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-vault-explorer)
-   [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)

For basic table usage, I recommend just using the native Obsidian table editor.

DataLoom is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for desktop and mobile. It allows you to create databases similar to [Notion.so](https://notion.so).

With DataLoom, you can weave together data from diverse sources and display them in different views. Use this plugin if you want a straightforward way to create and manage databases and enhance the organization of your Obsidian vault.

## Network Usage

According to [Obsidian developer policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies), an Obsidian plugin must explain which network services are used and why.

DataLoom will make one `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/releases/latest` to pull the latest release for the What's New Modal. Besides this, DataLoom does not make any network requests. DataLoom does not include client-side telemetry.

## License

DataLoom is distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Disclaimer

This plugin extends the functionality of Obsidian.md. Although tested during development, there may still be bugs in the software. I **strongly** recommend you to make frequent backup copies of your vault. I am not responsible for any data that is lost due to the usage of this plugin.
