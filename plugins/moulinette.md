It's designed with game masters in mind, streamlining the preparation process for role-playing campaigns and game sessions.

This plugin implements integration with Moulinette Cloud, providing the following capabilities:
* Search for images, sounds, and music, download them, and easily integrate them into your notes.
* Search for and download Obsidian notes (rules, snippets, tables, etc.)
