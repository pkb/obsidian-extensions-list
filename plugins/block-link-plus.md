# Block Link Plus

[copy-block-link](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link/tree/main) is one of my most frequently used plugins. However, it has always lacked support for creating multi-line text blocks. Therefore, I attempted to write block-link-plus. block-link-plus supports the creation of multi-line text blocks and offers more customization for block IDs.

for chinese version, please refer to [README_zh.md](README_zh.md)

## Usage

The usage is completely the same as [copy-block-link](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link/tree/main).

## Features

### Multi-line Text Blocks

Here, multi-line text specifically refers to: selected text that does not contain any titles across multiple lines.

Obsidian's block reference has not yet supported the creation of multi-line text blocks. block-link-plus uses two methods as a workaround.

The first method is using headings: adding the selected text to a new heading and copying the link pointing to that heading.
- Distinguish using `˅id` from normal headings
- Modify the rendering of `## ˅id` under reading mode and live preview to make it more similar to a normal block reference.


```bash
## ˅id
abc
def
## ^id

[[file#˅id]]
```

The second method creates multiple block references: batch creating multiple sets of block references and copying them to the clipboard
- This feature is inspired by @[Text Transporter](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter)

```bash
abc ^id1

def ^id2

gh ^id3

[[file#^id1]]
[[file#^id2]]
[[file#^id3]]
```

### Custom Block ID

Block ID = prefix-random characters
- Customize the prefix of the block ID and the length of random characters (3-7)

This feature currently does not have more practical uses, but perhaps more aggregation operations can be performed through the prefix of the block ID.

Block Link Plus is released under GNU GPLv3 (License).

## Thanks

Block Link Plus is my first Obsidian plugin. During the development process, I referred to a large number of existing plugins. I am grateful to these open-source projects.
