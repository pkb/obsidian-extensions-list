# Mathpad

Mathpad is a Computer Algebra System (CAS) or, simply put, a calculator on steroid.
It is based on Nerdamer [Nerdamer](https://nerdamer.com/) for the symbolic and numeric calculations and on [function-plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) for the 2D plotting

It consists of a sidebar, code block and inline block support.

The sidebar works as a stand-alone numeric and symbolic calculator that could also be used to copy the results as a dynamic code block, or as static LaTeX into Obsidian notes.

Code Blocks and Inline Code allows to insert computations and plotting inside Obsidian notes.

Here a preview of the sidebar:
