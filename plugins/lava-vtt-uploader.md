# Lava VTT Uploader

This plugin allows you to display images from your obsidian vault in Lava VTT.

## What is Lava VTT?

Lava VTT is a virtual tabletop intended for usage in non-virtual play. It is
designed to be used on a TV or projector to display maps and other images to
your players directly at the table.

If your DM manages their campaign in Obsidian, this plugin is ideal for
seamlessly sharing maps and images directly from their campaign notes.

Currently, Lava VTT is not a publicly hosted service and must be self-hosted.
You can find the source code and instructions for setting up Lava VTT at
https://github.com/lavaforge/lava-vtt.

## Configuration

Since Lava VTT is self-hosted, you will need to configure the plugin with the
URL of your Lava VTT instance. You can do this by setting the _"Server Address"_
in the obsidian settings for this plugin. This should be the full URL of your
Lava VTT instance, including the port, if necessary.

## Usage

To display an image from your vault in Lava VTT, you can just right-click on the
image in one of your notes and then click "Display in Lava VTT".
