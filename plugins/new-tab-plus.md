# New Tab +

## Main feature

Allow to open markdown files, graph and canvas in new tab as the default behavior.

## Optional feature

Upon opening a file or canvas, if a version of the file is already open in your tab, focus on the version of the file instead. (toggleable)

# Bugs / issues

It is my first plugin project on Obsidian so don't hesitate to report me any unwanted behavior on https://github.com/Raphlette/obsidian-new-tab-plus/issues.
