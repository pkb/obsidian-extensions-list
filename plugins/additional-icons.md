# Additional Icons for Obsidian
This plugin adds additional icons for use anywhere obsidian normally uses the set from https://lucide.dev/ .

At present, it includes:

| Icon Library | License |
|-|-|
| [RPG Awesome](https://nagoshiashumari.github.io/Rpg-Awesome/) | [SIL OFL 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/) |
| [GovIcons](https://govicons.io/) | [SIL OFL 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/) |
| [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) | [SIL OFL 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/) |

Each iconset is bundled with the built plugin, but can be toggled.

# Example Usage

I tend to use a lot of `fileClass`es from [metadata
menu](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/), and often use the `icon`
field to give the files individual icons based on their type.  I found myself
wanting to use different icons than those available in the default Lucide set
that came with Obsidian.  So now you can use things like `ra-axe`, `gi-dna` and
`wi-tornado` to decorate your files.

# License

This repository is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.  The fonts bundled
with the built version (which are not distributed with source) are licensed as
noted above.

# Funding
