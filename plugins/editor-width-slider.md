# Obsidian Line Width Slider Plugin
> A plugin for Obsidian that allows you to adjust the editor line width using a simple slider in the status bar.

## Features

- Adjust the line width of the editor using a slider in the status bar.
- Increase or decrease the line width to customize your editing experience.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.

### Feature: Custom for Individual Files using YAML

With the Obsidian Line Width Slider Plugin, you can now customize the editor width for individual files by specifying an "editor-width" field in the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This feature allows you to have different line widths for different files, giving you greater flexibility in your note-taking and editing experience.

#### Setting the Editor Width

To set a custom editor width for a specific file, follow these steps:

1. Open the note for which you want to customize the editor width.

2. In the YAML frontmatter section at the top of the note, add an "editor-width" field. The value of this field should be a number between 0 and 100, representing the desired editor width as a percentage of the viewport width. For example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: My Customized Note
   editor-width: 75
   ---
   ```
