ExcaliBrain is inspired by [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com) and [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs). It is an interactive, structured mind-map of your Obsidian Vault generated based on the folders and files in your Vault by interpreting the links, dataview fields, tags and YAML front matter in your markdown files.

ExcaliBrain distinguishes 5 type of relationships between your notes:
- Children
- Parents
- Friends
- Other Friends (lateral relationships on the right side)
- Siblings

Relationships are derived based on the following logic
- Explicitly defined relationships specified by using dataview fields. (e.g. `Author:: [[Isaac Asimov]]`)
- Inferred relationships (without the use of dataview fields)
  - A forward-link is inferred as a child
  - A backlink is inerred as a parent
  - If files mutually link to each other they are friends
  - The children of the parents are the siblings

# Prerequisites
ExcaliBrain is built on top of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin). You must have both these plugins installed and enabled for ExcaliBrain to work.

ExcaliBrain is optimized to work well with [Hover Editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor).
