# Focus Time Plugin

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

The Focus Time Plugin automatically tracks the time you spend focused on your notes and allows you to view the data of your total focus time for each note. With this tool, you can better review your focus journey, uncover "hidden gem notes" marked by time, and make your Obsidian note-taking more planned and rewarding!

If you find this plugin useful, you can support me on [Afdian](https://afdian.com/a/astradev). Your encouragement is the driving force behind my continued development.

## User Guide

### Track Focus Time

Every time you open a note, the plugin automatically starts tracking your focus time, which is displayed in the status bar at the bottom right. When you switch notes or minimize Obsidian, the plugin stops tracking and saves the data (you can disable window detection in the plugin settings by turning off focus mode).
