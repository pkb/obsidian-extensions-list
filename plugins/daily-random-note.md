# Daily Random Note

## Introduction
Do you constantly forget what you've written in your notes?

Want to refresh your mind with book notes you've taken in the past?

If so, **Daily Random Note** is for you.

## How to use

You can create `Random Instances`, where you define which folders to query files from, and even filter using tags.

Each `Random Instance` will open a random file according to your specifications, at the time of the day you define (this might be helpful if you're a night owl and don't want to see your random notes at midnight).

At the reset time, obsidian will open all your random notes in new tabs.

Here's an example of how your settings should look like:

In case you don't want the daily feature and just want to read a random note of yours, that's possible using the ribbon icon (see figure below).
