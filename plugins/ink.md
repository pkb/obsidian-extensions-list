# Ink
A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that adds the ability to hand write or draw with a stylus between paragraphs in your notes.

Hand write or draw directly between paragraphs in your notes using a digital pen, stylus, or Apple pencil. Useful for handwriting, sketches, scribbles, or even math equations and scientific notation. Runs on the tldraw framework and drawing provides an infinite canvas.

**Demo Note**<br/>
In the video above, I have set up this plugin's commands to be visible in another plugin called [Slash Commander](https://github.com/alephpiece/obsidian-slash-commander) - This allows me to select the insert command quickly by simply typing `/`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful
>As with most Obsidian plugins, this is a free gift to the community, provided 'as is' to help you out. While I'm doing my best to make it awesome (And I love feedback), there are always chances things might not work quite right. To be safe, **please always back up your files**.

## ü™≥ Report a bug
Found something that's not quite working right or do you have a feature request? Don't be shy, feel free to make some noise over on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/daledesilva/obsidian_project-browser/issues) page. But be sure to check if someone has already posted the same issue and comment on theirs if they have.

## üíæ Installation
You can find this plugin in the plugin directory within Obsidian.
<details>
<summary>Click for help installing plugins</summary>

1. Open your Obsidian vault and go to **Settings**.

2. Click on **Community Plugins** in the side bar.

3. If you haven't already, you will need to turn on community plugins.

4. Search 'Dale de Silva' and install **Ink**.
</details>

If you would like to install new versions of the plugin that are still being tested, you can install this plugin through BRAT instead.
BRAT is another community plugin that allows you to install a Beta version. New features are released as a Beta version first and can take from a few days to a month before landing in the standard version.
<details>
<summary>Click for Beta version installation instructions</summary>

1. Open your Obsidian vault and go to **Settings**.
2. Click on **Community Plugins** in the side bar.
3. Turn on community plugins and click **Browse**.
4. Search and install **BRAT**.
5. Scroll down and **activate** BRAT.
6. In the BRAT menu in the side pane, select **Add Beta Plugin**.
7. Follow the instructions presented.
8. When a URL is requested, use: `https://github.com/daledesilva/obsidian_ink`

</details>
<details>
<summary>Click for Beta version update instructions</summary>

- BRAT is set to update Beta plugins by default on startup, however, this can sometimes take some time.
- To force an update, run BRAT's Obsidian commnd `Choose a single plugin to update` and choose Ink.

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

#### Optimisation Notes
The plugin currently works based on the [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/) framework, however, tldraw is implemented using SVG elements which slow down greatly on iOS platforms and possibly others. This equates to significant lag while writing after about 200-300 strokes on iOS (Which is about 3-4 paragraphs). To temporarily mitigate this, the plugin hides strokes while writing that are several lines old. The strokes are still saved and reappear upon freezing the embed, reopening the file, or adjusting the infinite canvas view.

In the future, this plugin will transition off tldraw (at least for writing functionality), to Canvas based input. When this occurs any files that users have created will be converted automatically if necessary‚ÄîYou can count on this as I already have many files in my own vaults that rely on this plugin.

#### Embed Format Notes
The embed implementation is currently based on a code block that tells the plugin how to display the embed. I'm not happy with this, however, as it means if anyone ever wants to transition off this plugin they have to keep it installed in order to see their old handwritten sections.

I will be modifying this to simply be an image embed that the plugin recognises and enhances. This will mean that even if you uninstall the plugin, all your embeds will still be visible as static images.

#### Drawing Functionality Notes
There's currently 2 file formats that the plugin implements as embeddable sections. A handwriting file, and a drawing file. This enables the plugin to aid the user in different ways and provide more intuitive UIs for each input mode. The drawing file, however, while I have found that I already prefer using it over other Obsidian plugins, is not the primary goal of this plugin at this stage. It should therefore be treated with caution regarding future support.

Note, however, that the embed format described above will apply here also, which means your exist drawings will still remain visible as static images even if support is removed.

Note also that the drawing functionality will not take the place of Excalidraw. Excalidraw provides a feature rich ability to diagram holistically, whereas this plugin is built around freeform natural pen input. I personally like sketching more freeform with only minimal aid of drag and drop elements, so this is what drawing here is focussed on as that aligns with a handwritten style of taking notes as well.
