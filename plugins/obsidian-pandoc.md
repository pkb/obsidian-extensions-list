## Obsidian Pandoc Plugin

This is a Pandoc export plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It adds command palette options to export your notes to a variety of formats including Word Documents, PDFs, ePub books, HTML websites, PowerPoints and LaTeX among (many) others. This is all thanks to [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

This lets you **write presentations**, **draft books**, **make webpages**, and **write assignments** all in Markdown, and export to whichever format you fancy, all without leaving Obsidian.

Note: this plugin is in beta, and there are often minor formatting issues. Make sure to proof-read the output!
