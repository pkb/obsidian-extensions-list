# Function

This plugin can quickly display recently added files, making it easier to process these documents.
For example: After adding pictures, quickly find and rename them

## Rename newly added files

During the document editing process, adding multiple images with the same name can lead to name duplication. To address this, an MD5 renaming feature has been added to quickly update the names of newly added images.

# üôè Acknowledgements

The core functionality of this project relies heavily on the incredible work done by the [recent-files-obsidian](https://github.com/tgrosinger/recent-files-obsidian) project. I am deeply grateful for its contributions.

While using Obsidian to edit documents, I frequently add numerous documents and images, making it difficult to locate newly added files for editing. I discovered the functionality of the **recent-files-obsidian** plugin, which displays recently opened or edited files, but it didn‚Äôt fully meet my needs. Therefore, I redesigned its functionality to support displaying only newly added files.
