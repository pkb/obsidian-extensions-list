Easily Shift and Change markdown headings.

## Why use this plugin

Obsidian links numerous markdown files to form knowledge. Daily rearrangement of links is important to create a good knowledge base.

The following situations often occur in this process.

1. Cut out A part of File 1 to an independent File 2 and linked.
    - Heading3 in file 1 is changed to Heading1 in file 2
2. Incorporated the content of File 3 into a part of File 4
    - Heading2 in file 3 is changed to Heading4 in file 4

With this plugin, you can change the Heading size (the number of `#`) in a batch instead of changing it manually.

## How to install

### From within Obsidian

You can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

-   Open Settings > Community plugin

## line

#### Use Case

Operate headings like an outliner like the following,

```markdown
# The Festival Myster -> hit "Apply 1"

This is a great document.

## Chapter One -> hit "Insert deeper"

### Prologue -> hit "Insert deeper"

The sun was setting over the horizon...

### The Summer Festival -> hit "Insert current"

As the townspeople gathered in the town square...

## Chapter Two -> hit "Insert higher"

### The Mystery of the Missing Prize -> hit "Insert deeper"

As the summer festival came to a close...
```

If you want to make headings deeper or higher than 2, use "shift" or "apply".
